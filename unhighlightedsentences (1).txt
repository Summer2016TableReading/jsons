2538768:�n 19 patients sufficient tumour tissue was available for immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR ( Tables 2 and 4 )
2538768:Metastases were metachronous in all cases; the median time elapsed between resection of the primary tumour and the corresponding metastatic site was 30 months (range, 4�143)
2538768:The incidence of EGFR overexpression (grade 2+, 3+) was 26.5% in both primary and metastatic tumours
2538768:Several studies have shown that activating EGFR mutations in exons 18, 19 and 21 have been associated with a 75�95% objective response rate with EGFR TKIs, whereas the K-RAS mutations were associated with a lack of sensitivity to these agents ( Pao et al , 2005 ; Sharma et al , 2007 )

2538768:As, in most studies, EGFR expression and mutations were determined on the primary tumour, the observed clinical benefit of patients with wild-type EGFR or the absence of response to TKIs of patients with EGFR mutations could be due to discordance in the EGFR mutation status or expression between the primary tumour and the corresponding metastasis

2538768:Among the five (20%) K-RAS mutations detected in the primary tumours, two were maintained in the corresponding metastasis
2538768:Three out of 16 (18.8%) primary and seven out of 16 (43.8%) metastatic tumours expressed phosphorylated EGFR (pY1173-EGFR-positive)
2538768:The primary anti-phospho-EGFR antibody (rabbit monoclonal, pY1173-EGFR, code no
2538768:However, in clinical studies, a significant percentage of patients presented clinical benefit when treated with TKIs irrespective of the expression and mutational status of EGFR ( Sharma et al , 2007 )
2538768:Discordance between the primary and metastatic tumours was observed in eight (50%) patients (McNemar test, P =1) ( Tables 2 and 4 )
2538768:Secondary objectives were to explore whether the EGFR expression pattern correlated to EGFR and/or K-RAS mutations in both the primary tumours and corresponding metastases
2538768:Among them, two (nos 13 and 19) patients presented different EGFR mutation status in the primary tumours and corresponding metastases; however, these two patients harbour non-classical EGFR mutations (T847A and G857E) and did not show different EGFR amplification patterns between paired samples
2538768:In this study, the mutation status of EGFR and K-RAS as well as the EGFR and p-EGFR expressions on the primary tumours and the corresponding metastatic lesions were evaluated in 25 patients with advanced NSCLC
2538768:10 and 23) carried the same K-RAS mutations in both primary and metastatic tumours ( Table 2 )
2538768:All sequence variations were confirmed by sequencing in both directions and by an independent PCR amplification when sufficient material was available
2538768:Patients, aged >18 years old, with histologically confirmed NSCLC who underwent biopsy or surgical excision of the primary tumour and the corresponding metastases were included in this retrospective analysis
2538768:Patient no
2538768:Histological type was determined according to the World Health Organization criteria, and the stage of the disease corresponds to that of the time of primary diagnosis
2538768:Previous studies have shown that EGFR and K-RAS mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting the presence of different pathways of lung carcinogenesis
2538768:One of them (case no
2538768:18, 20 and 23) and two carried EGFR mutations of unknown function (nos
2538768:Our study failed to demonstrate such a correlation probably due to limited number of cases analysed
2538768:The EGFR mutation status of the primary tumours and the corresponding metastases is presented in Table 2 
2538768:Epidermal growth factor receptor and K-RAS mutation status was different between primary tumours and corresponding metastases in 7 (28%) and 6 (24%) of the 25 patients, respectively
2538768:17 and 19), respectively
2538768:Therefore, EGFR mutation status showed a discordance of 28% (7 of 25 patients) (McNemar test, P =0.688) between the primary tumour and corresponding metastasis ( Table 3 )
2538768:Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were detected in the primary tumours of five (20%) patients; of these, three of them were the well-characterised �hotspot' mutations in exon 19 (Del746-750 and E746V; case nos
2538768:An alternative model proposes that the metastatic potential is encoded in the mass of a given primary tumour that has progressed to a pre-metastatic state, after which metastases may randomly occur without any further gene expression changes ( van �t Veer et al , 2002 ; Hynes, 2003 ; Van't Veer and Weigelt, 2003 )
2538768:The first PCR was carried out in a total volume of 10? ? l contained 1/10 of the extracted genomic DNA using 1?U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
2538768:Fast red was used as chromogen for 20?min; the sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin for 3?min, subsequently rinsed in ammonium and finally mounted with glycergel
2538768:pY1173-EGFR immunostaining was mainly membranous and was graded as 0 (<5% positive cells), 1+ (5�19% positive cells), 2+ (20�50% positive cells) and 3+ (>50% positive cells) ( Cortas et al , 2007 )
2538768:The primary tumour tissue was the lung ( n =25 patients); and the origin of the metastatic sample was lung ( n =9 patients), thoracic wall ( n =5 patients), adrenal gland ( n =4 patients), brain ( n =3 patients), bone ( n =2 patients), liver ( n =1 patient) and skin ( n =1 patient)
2538768:In addition, several clinicopathological characteristics, such as adenocarcinoma histology, non-smoking history, female gender and Asian origin, are also associated with a higher probability of response to TKIs, whereas the presence of K-RAS mutations seems to be correlated with primary resistance to these agents ( Tokumo et al , 2005 ; Tsao et al , 2005 ; van Zandwijk et al , 2007 )

2538768:17) and G857E (no
2538768:Although K-RAS mutations seem to be associated with the early development of NSCLC, it cannot be excluded that K-RAS mutations are lost later during tumour progression ( Burmer and Loeb, 1989 ; Li et al , 1994 )
2538768:Evaluable paired tissue specimens for fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis were available for eight patients
2538768:Three out of 25 patients received gefitinib before the development of a metachronous metastasis, whereas none of the patients reported in the Matsumoto's et al study had exposed to TKIs
2538768:The corresponding metastases of the Del746-750 (case no
2538768:A positive (an NSCLC tumour specimen with known positivity) and a negative (omission of primary antibody) control were used
2538768:Immunoreactions of EGFR were graded as 3+ when strong complete membrane staining was observed in more than 10% of the tumour cells, as 2+ when more than 10% of the tumour cells showed weak-to-moderate complete membrane staining, as 1+ when partially, faint membrane stain was detected in more than 10% of the tumour cells and as 0 when no staining at all or membrane staining in less than 10% of the tumour cells was observed
2538768:This may, in part, explain the discordance in the K-RAS mutation status between primary tumours and metachronous metastases
2538768:In this study, we arbitrarily classified EGFR expression status in two subsets; the 2+ or 3+ signals were considered as EGFR overexpression and the 0 or 1+ signals as non-expression ( Koutsopoulos et al , 2007 )
2538768:Therefore, acquisition of new mutations may be developed during the evolution of the metastatic process
2538768:14 and 15) (McNemar test, P =1)
2538768:The PCR primers for EGFR amplification were as follows: 155273L23: 5?-TCCCAAACACTCAGTGAAACAAA-3?; 155348L22: 5?-TGGTCTCACAGGACCACTGATT-3?; 154838U22: 5?-TCAGAGCCTGTGTTTCTACCAA-3?; 154899U20: 5?-TCCAAATGAGCTGGCAAGTG-3?; 55634U24: 5?-AAATAATCAGTGTGATTCGTGGAG-3?; 156027L20: 5?-TGTGGAGATGAGCAGGGTCT-3?; 156107L22: 5?-GAGGCCAGTGCTGTCTCTAAGG-3?; 155750U20: 5?-GTGCATCGCTGGTAACATCC-3?; 173160L22: 5?-CAGCTCTGGCTCACACTACCAG-3?; 173076L19: 5?-CATCCTCCCCTGCATGTGT-3?; 172656U22: 5?-GCAGCGGGTTACATCTTCTTTC-3?; and 172747U19: 5?-GCT CAGAGCCTGGCATGAA-3?
2538768:On the basis of these findings, at the present time, we consider that only the genetic differences unequivocally distinguish EGFR-dependent tumours, which are likely to be sensitive to TKIs from the tumours that could be resistant to these agents ( Papadopoulos et al , 2006 )
2538768:17 and 19)
2538768:The study has been approved by the Ethics and Scientific Committees of our institution
2538768:All statistical tests were two-sided
2538768:Nine (36%) patients were treated with gefitinib in the context of an Expanded Access Program ( Table 2 )
2538768:All patients who experienced progressive disease on gefitinib were wild type regarding the EGFR mutation status in both primary tumours and metastases (nos
2538768:The classical model for the metastatic process suggests that most cells of a given primary tumour have low metastatic potential and only a few cells acquire enough somatic mutations to become metastatic ( Bernards and Weinberg, 2002 )
2538768:20); conversely, the other two patients carried two novel mutations in exon 18 (L692P and V717A; no
2538768:20, 23 and 18) and the remaining two were novel point mutations in exons 18 and 21 (L692P and G857E; case nos
2538768:Lung cancer is the most frequent solid tumour and represents the leading cause of cancer death throughout the developed world
2538768:The patients' clinicopathologic characteristics are presented in Table 1 
2538768:14, 15, 16, 19, 22 and 23)
2538768:Non-small-cell lung carcinoma is characterised by the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations ( Marsit et al , 2004 ; Yokota and Kohno, 2004 ; Garnis et al , 2006 )
2538768:12) and the T847A (no
2538768:The sensitivity of our methodology was evaluated by determining the minimum frequency of EGFR and K-RAS mutations required for detection in our system
2538768:This patient received gefitinib after the biopsy of metastatic lesion and had stable disease lasting for 3.5 months
2538768:Almost 70% of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis
2538768:However, as shown in Table 1 , among the 10 patients who had not received any treatment before the mutation analysis of the metastatic lesions, 5 developed metastases with different mutation status from that of the corresponding primary tumours
2538768:However, the EGFR and K-RAS mutation status in metastases is not well studied
2538768:Nine patients received gefitinib as first (nos
2538768:The limited duration of response is compatible with the knowledge that the presence of K-RAS mutations is associated with resistance to TKIs
2538768:19) mutant primary tumours were wild type with respect to EGFR mutation status
2538768:Eighteen (72%) patients had adenocarcinomas (ADC) and 21 (84%) patients had stage III or IV disease
2538768:23, who received gefitinib after metastasis, carried both EGFR and K-RAS mutations in the primary tumour and the same K-RAS mutation in metastasis
2538768:In the metachronous metastasis, only the K-RAS mutation was retained
2538768:Mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) account for increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; gefitinib and erlotinib) and they are associated with prolonged overall survival ( Lynch et al , 2004 ; Paez et al , 2004 ; Perez-Soler et al , 2004 ; Chou et al , 2005 ; Taron et al , 2005 ; Hirsch, 2006 )
2538768:Taking into account these two models, a critical issue for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC is the question of genetic variability and differences between the primary tumour and the corresponding metastases
2538768:Among the 25 primary tumours, three �hotspot' and two non-classical EGFR mutations were found; none of the corresponding metastases had the same mutation pattern
2538768:This study was supported by a research grant from the Cretan Association for Biomedical Research (CABR).
2538768:13 and 12) carrying the abovementioned mutations was 74.5 and 10 months, respectively
2538768:Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the expression of EGFR as assessed by gene copy number, mRNA and protein levels could be used to predict responsiveness to therapy with TKIs ( Hirsch et al , 2005 ; Taron et al , 2005 ; Dacic et al , 2006 ; Dziadziuszko et al , 2006 ; Endo et al , 2006 )

2538768:Concerning the non-classical mutations, it is unlikely to represent PCR artifacts, as L692F, T847I and G857E EGFR mutations have been previously reported ( Fujimoto et al , 2005 ; Tsao et al , 2005 ; Hsieh et al , 2006 )
2538768:Thus, an emerging issue concerning EGFR-targeted therapy is to identify the best method for selecting patients who are more likely to benefit from EGFR inhibition
2538768:The initial denaturing step was at 94�C for 15?min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing step at 94�C for 20?s, annealing step at 60�C for 30?s and extension step at 72�C for 1?min, ending with a final extension step at 72�C for 7?min
2538768:Three patients received gefitinib before the biopsy of metachronous metastases (nos
2538768:The apparent lack of correlation between EGFR and p-EGFR expression has been previously reported and could be due to the different scoring systems and different sensitivities of antibodies used to evaluate the EGFR and p-EGFR expressions ( Han et al , 2005 )
2538768:Clinical investigations suggested a correlation between a high EGFR gene copy number and EGFR mutations ( Cappuzzo et al , 2005 ; Takano et al , 2005 )
2538768:The stained sections were independently evaluated by two pathologists (AK and ES)
2538768:13) in exon 21, which could not be detected in the patients' primary tumour samples
2538768:In this study, the expression of pY1173-EGFR was different between primary tumours and corresponding metastases in eight (50%) patients, whereas EGFR expression was discordant in two (10%) patients
2538768:Exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the EGFR and exon 1 of K-RAS were sequentially amplified by two rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to direct sequencing
2538768:We have confirmed that the non-classical mutations detected in our series are not single nucleotide polymorphisms by mutation analysis of matched normal tissue or blood (data not shown)
2538768:The time elapsed between diagnoses of the primary tumour and corresponding metastasis in patients (nos
2538768:It is known that NSCLC patients with EGFR-dependent primary tumours when treated with TKIs can develop metastases, in which either the EGFR signalling is negated or resistance is acquired due to secondary EGFR mutations like T790M or MET amplification ( Daneshmand et al , 2003 ; Gazdar and Minna, 2005 ; Engelman et al , 2007 ; Lutterbach et al , 2007 )
2538768:2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 19 and 24) for whom paired tissue specimens were available; amplification of EGFR gene was not detected in any of these tumour specimens
2538768:Twenty-two (88%) patients were men and 22 (88%) were active or former smokers and their median age was 55 years (range, 41�70)
2538768:18) or had acquired resistance because of the T790M EGFR mutation (no
2538768:However, as previously reported, our data show that K-RAS mutation may coexist with EGFR mutation ( Fujimoto et al , 2005 ; Han et al , 2006 )
2538768:All the five patients with stable disease on gefitinib carried EGFR mutations in their primary tumours (nos
2538768:Our findings concerning the K-RAS mutation status are in agreement with a previous study demonstrating that the K-RAS mutational status of the primary tumour does not always predict the status of bone metastasis in NSCLC ( Badalian et al , 2007 )
2538768:8102, Cell Signalling) was used to validate the antibody for p-EGFR
2538768:However, a final explanation of the observed discordance, which cannot be excluded, concerns the low-frequency intratumoral heterogeneity for the occurrence of EGFR mutations ( Sakurada et al , 2008 )
2538768:Primary and metastatic tumours were also assessed for K-RAS mutations ( Table 2 )
2538768:22) or metastasis (no
2538768:All tumour samples were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues
2538768:17, 18, 19, 20 and 23)
2538768:However, biochemical studies have shown that variable phosphorylation rates were associated with different tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the receptor; G719S mutant receptor had less EGF-induced phosphorylation at Y845, Y992, Y1068 and Y1173 than did wild-type EGFR, whereas L858R mutant receptor preferentially phosphorylated at the Y1068 but not at Y1173 ( Sordella et al , 2004 ; Chen et al , 2006 ; Liu et al , 2007 )
2538768:In order to confirm our findings, we repeated the immunohistochemistry from serial sections in all tumour specimens that exhibited EGFR-negative and p-EGFR-positive staining and the obtained results were identical
2538768:18 and 20 who received gefitinib before metachronous metastasis developed metastatic tumours, which were either wild type in respect to EGFR mutation status (no
2538768:8, 10, 22, 23 and 25) and in the metastatic tumours of five (20%) patients (nos
2538768:Five patients (56%) achieved stable disease and four (44%) progressive disease ( Table 2 )
2538768:This was confirmed by three independent PCRs from three genomic DNAs extracted from serial sections of the paraffin blocks
2538768:Diverse sites of metastases in NSCLC probably represent different clonal outgrowths
2538768:16)
2538768:23) carried the Del746-750 EGFR mutation in the primary tumour but not in metastasis
2538768:Of these, three patients carried the well-characterised activating mutations in exon 19 (nos
2538768:We conclude that there is substantial discordance in EGFR and K-RAS mutational status between the primary tumours and corresponding metastases in patients with NSCLC and this might have therapeutic implications when treatment with TKIs is considered
2538768:20)
2538768:Concordance between the primary tumour and the corresponding metastases was observed in 17 (89.5) patients (Cohen's Kappa=0.729, P =0.001) and among them EGFR was overexpressed in four (21.1%)
2538768:Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated EGFR (pY1173-EGFR-positive) on tumour cells from metastatic lesions carrying the T847A and L692P-V717A mutations strongly suggests that the former might be activating EGFR mutation
2538768:Another possibility for the observed discordance in the EGFR and K-RAS mutation status could be related to the administered chemotherapy
2538768:Consequently, the EGFR gene status could be classified as: (i) EGFR wild type in both primary tumour and metastasis ( n =18 patients; 72%), and (ii) EGFR mutations detected only in the primary tumour ( n =4 patients; 16%) or the metastases ( n =2 patients; 8%) or both ( n =1 patient; 4%)
2538768:Evaluable paired tissue specimens for p-EGFR analysis by IHC were available in 16 patients
2538768:In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and K-RAS mutations of the primary tumour are associated with responsiveness and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), respectively
2538768:Among the five patients with EGFR mutations in primary tumours, one patient concomitantly had K-RAS mutation (G12C with deletion in exon 19)
2538768:Alternatively, we cannot exclude that the different ethnicity of patients and/or the different types of EGFR mutations could be the reason for this discrepancy ( Tsao et al , 2006 ; Pallis et al , 2007 )
2538768:In this study including only Caucasian patients, three classical activating (Del19 and E746V) and four non-classical mutations (T847A, L692P-V717A, L692P and G857E) were detected, whereas in Matsumoto's et al study, only classical activating Del19 and L858R mutations were reported
2538768:McNemar test was used to compare the EGFR and K-RAS status between primary tumours and related metastatic sites
2538768:Patient nos
2538768:The discordance in EGFR mutation status was 28% and that in K-RAS was 24%
2538768:9, 10, 11, 16 and 23), respectively
2538768:Discordance was observed in two (10.5%) patients (nos
2538768:Epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification and protein expression have also been considered as predictors of clinical benefit with gefitinib ( Hirsch et al , 2006 )

2538768:17, 18 and 20) and six received gefitinib after the biopsy of metastases (nos
2538768:The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of EGFR and K-RAS mutations in metastases and to examine whether these mutations and the EGFR expression patterns are discordant between the primary tumours and the corresponding metastases
2538768:Subsequently, tissue samples from at least three serial sections were microdissected (piezo power Eppendorf Microdissector; Eppendorf, Germany) to ensure that specimens contained at least 80% tumour cells; sections of 5? ? m thickness were also collected from adjacent normal tissue when available, extracted with xylene and ethanol to remove paraffin and placed in 1% SDS/proteinase K (10?mg?ml?1) at 56�C overnight
2538768:Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were detected in the metastatic tumours of three (12%) patients ( Table 2 )
2538768:After deparaffinisation, the slides for EGFR were treated with proteinase K (Code S3020, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) for 5?min at room temperature, and those for p-EGFR were treated with EDTA at pH 8 in a microwave oven three times for 5?min at 500?W for antigen retrieval
2538768:The administration of TKIs could be an additional explanation of the observed discordance of EGFR mutations
2538768:Among the 50 samples analysed (25 primary tumours and 25 metastases), 26 (52%) samples were surgical and 24 (48%) biopsies
2538768:Therefore, it is unclear whether the same EGFR and K-RAS mutations are also present in the metastatic lesions or whether clones with different mutations are responsible for the generation of metastases
2538768:23 and 18), third (nos
2538768:Sequence analysis was carried out by Seqscape software (Applied Biosystems) and manually by two reviewers (AK and AV)
2538768:The metastasis of one of these patients showed the same EGFR mutation (Del19) as the primary tumour as well as an additional one, the T790M in exon 20 (no
2538768:Advanced NSCLC metastasises systemically to diverse sites, such as the brain, bone, adrenal glands and liver
2538768:The paraffin-embedded tissues were cut at 4? ? m thickness and were deposited on SuperFrost/Plus Slides (O.Kindler GmbH, Freiburg, Germany)
2538768:K-RAS mutations were detected in the primary tumours of five (20%) patients (nos
2538768:It is interesting to note that in patients who had not been exposed to TKIs before biopsy of metastatic lesions, a 18% (4 out of 22 patients) discordance was observed between primary tumours and related metastases
2538768:Discordance in K-RAS mutation status between the primary tumours and the corresponding metastases was observed in six (24%) patients (McNemar test, P =1) ( Table 3 )
2538768:Thus, although tumour clone selection through the various treatments could be an explanation for the different molecular pattern in the primary tumour and metastatic site, our findings suggest that the metastasis genotype could be different from that of the corresponding primary tumour irrespectively of administered chemotherapy
2538768:TL-125-AL, Lab Vision, Fremont, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions
2538768:Similarly, two other studies in paired NSCLC tumours showed a discordance of 32 and 27% regarding the EGFR gene copy number ( Italiano et al , 2006 ; Bozzetti et al , 2008 ), whereas another study including six NSCLC patients of Asian ethnicity reported a 100% concordance in regard to EGFR mutation status ( Matsumoto et al , 2006 )
2538768:The primary anti-EGFR antibody (mouse monoclonal, clone H11, code M3563, DakoCytomation) was used at a dilution of 1?:?50 (v/v) and incubated for 1?h at room temperature
2538768:Differences were considered statistically significant when the P -value was <0.05
2538768:This study demonstrated the existence of a significant discordance of EGFR and K-RAS mutations occurring in primary tumours and their corresponding metastases in patients with NSCLC
2538768:Sections of a paraffin block corresponding to one representative area of the tumour were stained with haematoxylin/eosin, and the presence of tumour tissue was verified by an experienced pathologist
2538768:This discrepancy could be related to the different sites of the metastatic tumours analysed in this study (five different distant metastases), whereas in the Matsumoto's et al study, only tumour samples from brain metastases were included
2538768:However, the point mutation T790M and an insertion mutation in exon 20 were associated with resistance to TKIs ( Gazdar and Minna, 2005 )
2538768:Epidermal growth factor receptor and K-RAS mutations were detected in the metastatic tumours of three (12%) and five (20%) patients, respectively
2538768:In the majority of studies, EGFR and K-RAS status was determined on the primary tumours and there are very few data concerning those of corresponding metastases ( Italiano et al , 2006 ; Matsumoto et al , 2006 )
2538768:All patients gave their informed consent for using their tumour sample for molecular and pathologic analysis
2538768:The PCR primers for K-RAS amplification were as follows: RASU1: 5?-AGGCCTGCTGAAAATGACTGAATA-3?; RASL1: 5?-CTGTATCAAAGAATGGTCCTGCAC-3?; RASU2: 5?-AAAATGACTGAATATAAACTTGTGG-3?; RASL2: 5?-CTCTATTGTTGGATCATATTCGTC-3?
2538768:Smoking history was obtained during the patient's first evaluation
2538768:In conclusion, our findings indicate a substantial discordance of EGFR and K-RAS mutations between the primary tumours and the corresponding metastases in NSCLC and underline the need to consider the genotype of both primary and metastatic tumours for selecting patients who will respond to therapy with TKIs
2538768:A paraffin block from the HCC827 lung epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line and commercially available positive controls (SignalSlide Phospho-EGF Receptor (Tyr1173) IHC Controls, code no

2538768:Nested PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20? ? l and the conditions were identical to the first PCR
2538768:Epidermal growth factor receptor gene copy number was also investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation in eight patients (nos
2538768:A similar phenomenon was also reported in patients with colorectal cancer ( Tortola et al , 2001 )
2538768:This was accomplished by performing mixing experiments using cell lines with and without EGFR (H2073-wt- EGFR and HCC827-Del19- EGFR ) or K-RAS (H2073-wt- K-RAS and A549-G12D- K-RAS ) mutations
2538768:The expressions of EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR showed 10 and 50% discordance, in that order
2538768:These experiments demonstrated that the Del19 and K-RAS mutations could be detected when present in 10 and 20% of the cells in the sample, respectively (data not shown)
2538768:It is well known that overexpression of EGFR is associated with Tyr phosphorylation of the receptor proteins and that mutations in the kinase domain may cause constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR ( Chen et al , 2006 )
2538768:We compared the mutation status of these genes between the primary tumours and the corresponding metastases of 25 patients
2538768:There was no correlation between the expression of EGFR and pY1173-EGFR
2474852:We used an assay of cellular cytotoxicity that measures the release of the lactose deydrogenase enzyme, LDH
2474852:Tumors also contained a strong inflammatory component
2474852:They all contributed to the intellectual content and to the experimental work in an honest manner
2474852:Finally, activating mutations in the PI3K pathway, an immediate downstream effector of Ras, occur in a subset of breast tumors [ 9 , 10 ]
2474852:In contrast, previous studies with MCF10A cells demonstrated that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity was necessary to inhibit anoikis upon matrix detachment, even in cells expressing activated Raf [ 16 ]
2474852:Trono, Lausanne, Switzerland; [ 24 ])
2474852:Expression of PHLDA1 mRNA and TDAG51 protein in breast cancer has recently been described [ 17 ]
2474852:(C) Growth of pLVTHM vector control or TDAG51 shRNA-expressing RasV12-transduced cells either in the presence of 0.2% DMSO control (left) or 0.25 ?M PD153035 (right) in ultra-low-attachment plates, assessed by the alamar blue growth assay
2474852:Strong TDAG51 induction by RasV12S35 transformation of mammary epithelial cells suggests that ERK activation may at least partially explain TDAG induction in these previous reports
2474852:The number of cells for initial plating and the alamar blue incubation times were determined by generating a standard curve of fluorescence versus cell number incubated with alamar blue for various times
2474852:We further analyzed the signal dependent expression of the PHLDA1 gene and its protein product, TDAG51
2474852:Plating cells initially at 25,000/well insures that fluorescence measurements will occur on a linear part of the curve with a 6-hour incubation time over the course of an experiment

2474852:Attached cells were treated with either DMSO or 10 ?M EdU for 4 hours, and cells grown in low attachment plates were treated with DMSO or 10 ?M EdU for 24 hours
2474852:Knockdown of this putative breast cancer tumor-suppressor gene resulted in increased ERK pathway activation and enhanced matrix-detached cellular proliferation of Ras/Raf transformed cells
2474852:Cell cycle profiles were generated using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and modeling cell cycle phases with the cell cycle option of FlowJo flow cytometry software (Tree Star, Inc.) after gating for viable, single cells
2474852:Transformation of HME16C by the RasV12G37 effector domain mutant but not activated Rlf-CAAX suggest that RasV12G37-binding effectors other than RalGEF contribute to mammary epithelial transformation
2474852:Identical results were found for the EGFR-specific inhibitor PD168393 used at 0.1 ?M, a concentration that specifically inhibits EGFR and Her-2 receptors [ 29 ](not shown)
2474852:The PHLDA1 gene was elevated in PD153035-treated RasV12- and RasV12S35-infected cells but was significantly dependent upon EGFR tyrosine kinase activity for upregulation in RasV12G37- and RasV12C40-infected cells (not shown), and the expression of the encoded TDAG51 protein approximately paralleled PHLDA1 RNA expression (Figure 4B )
2474852:(B) Ral A activation was determined by a pull-down assay for GTP-bound, activated Ral A (GTP-Ral A)
2474852:The blot was subsequently stripped and probed with an anti-Erk2 antibody (Erk2)
2474852:To assess activation of the ERK pathway, anti-phospho Erk western blotting was performed and showed significantly elevated Erk phosphoprotein in RasV12- and RasV12S35-infected HME16C cells relative to control pLRT-infected cells (Figure 1A )
2474852:The fold up-regulation or down-regulation of genes identified in microarray analysis is indicated for genes where this value exceeded two-fold, organized into categories according to broadly defined gene functions
2474852:In addition, blockade of MEK activity with the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059 prevented the transformation of RasV12- and RasV12S35-expressing cells
2474852:Cells were trypsinized and plated in 500 ?L appropriate growth media into 24-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) at 25,000 cells per well
2474852:The phospho-ERK blot was overexposed in order to reveal minimal levels of protein
2474852:RasV12- and Ras EDM-infected HME16C cells were grown in soft agar in the presence or absence of the EGFR-specific inhibitors, PD153035 and PD168393
2474852:Ras signal transduction pathways play an important role in breast cancer progression, as evidenced by the frequent over-expression of the Ras-activating epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR and ErbB2
2474852:Consistent with a tumor suppressor role, loss of TDAG51 increased ERK-mediated cellular proliferation
2474852:Anchorage-independent growth therefore correlated with maintenance of high Erk activity in HME16C cells
2474852:TDAG51 protein expression was down-regulated by interfering small hairpin RNA (shRNA), and the effects on cell proliferation and death were examined in Ras pathway-transformed breast epithelial cells
2474852:For colonies above 100 ?m in diameter, RasV12C40-infected cells were the most efficient at colony formation, despite the smaller mean size of colonies
2474852:The blot was stripped and probed with an anti-Erk 2 antibody (Erk 2) to verify equal protein loading
2474852:Indeed, one consequence of EGFR activation is ERK pathway activation and may explain the role of EGFR in cooperating with RasV12G37- and RasV12C40-mediated cell signaling to promote anchorage-independent growth
2474852:TDAG51 up-regulation was attenuated by MEK inhibition (Figure 5 )
2474852:Following EGFR inhibition, RasV12C40- and RasV12G37- transduced lines lost anchorage-independent growth, suggesting that non-ERK signaling pathways contribute to cellular transformation through an EGFR dependent mechanism
2474852:D
2474852:Dissecting the physiological consequences of individual Ras-mediated signaling pathways with respect to mammary epithelial transformation is of obvious interest
2474852:Western blotting of cellular lysates from cells treated with 0.25 ?M PD153035 showed that high levels of phosphorylated Erk were maintained only in RasV12- and RasV12S35-infected cells, but were significantly reduced in RasV12G37- or RasV12C40-infected cells treated with the inhibitor (Figure 3C ), while phoshorylated Akt was minimally affected (not shown)
2474852:To induce gene expression, cells were treated with 250 ng/mL doxycycline three days prior to injection, and mice were fed with doxycycline-containing diet (200 mg/kg, BioServ, Inc.) beginning four days prior to cell inoculation and continuing for the duration of the experiment
2474852:ERK pathway activation in Ras V12 and Ras V12S35 cells infected with pLVTHM or anti-TDAG51 shRNA 36-1 
2474852:For induction of proteins from the tetracycline-inducible retroviral expression vector pLRT, 250 ng/mL of doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to culture media
2474852:In cells that were serum starved for 24 hours and matrix detached for 6 hours, elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt were observed in RasV12-, RasV12C40-, and RasV12G37-infected HME16C, with highest levels present in RasV12-infected cells (Figure 1C )
2474852:A summary of the genes up- or down-regulated greater than 2-fold in the H-RasV12- and Ras effector domain mutant-infected HME16C cell lines is presented in Additional file 1 , organized according to broad categories of gene function
2474852:Two independent experiments for each comparison were performed, with a dye switch for each experiment, therefore yielding four separate data sets
2474852:By contrast, TDAG51 functioned as an anti-apoptotic factor downstream of insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) signaling as TDAG51 was required to protect NIH3T3 cells from apoptosis upon IGF-1 withdrawal [ 36 ]
2474852:(A) Western blotting of TDAG51 protein (TDAG51) from 5 ?g of cellular lysates from non-silencing vector control (pLVTHM) and anti-TDAG51 shRNA (36-1) -expressing cell lines as indicated
2474852:In our hands, expression of H-RasV12, H-RasV12G37, and Rlf-CAAX from the pLRT vector induced efficient soft agar colony growth, and H-RasV12S35 and H-RasV12C40 did not (not shown), identical to previously reported results [ 27 ]
2474852:(B) Incorporation of the nucleoside analogue EdU into cellular DNA measured in RasV12S35-expressing (left panel) or RasV12-expressing (right panel) HME16C infected with pLVTHM non-silencing vector control or anti-TDAG51 shRNA 36-1 after 48, 72, 96 or 120 hours growth in ultra-low attachment plates
2474852:A mechanism of action for TDAG51 is not known
2474852:Cells were treated with 250 ng/mL doxycycline for 72 hours to induce gene expression, and anti-HA (HA tag) and anti-Ras (Ras) western blotting were performed
2474852:The RasV12- and RasV12 EDM-expressing cells grew well, while the growth of the Rlf-CAAX-expressing cells was significantly less
2474852:Only activation of the ERK pathway was sufficient to transform cells in the presence of EGFR inhibition and was sufficient for tumorigenesis in xenografts
2474852:To assess activation of the PI3K signaling pathway, anti-phosphoAkt (Ser473) western blotting was performed to detect activated, phosphorylated Akt
2474852:This suggests that TDAG51 might act in conjunction with both cellular stress, in this case matrix detachment, and a proliferative signal, in this case oncogenic activation
2474852:In order to understand the impact of dysregulated signaling pathways upon gene expression and function, it is necessary to connect differential gene expression to upstream signaling pathways
2474852:Transduction of HME16C with pathway-discriminating Ras effector domain mutants demonstrated that multiple downstream Ras signal transduction pathways contribute to anchorage-independent growth including Raf-, RalGEF-, and PI3K-mediated signaling
2474852:Elevated levels of phosphorylated Erk were also observed in RasV12G37- and RasV12C40-infected cells, although at a much lower level than that found in RasV12- and RasV12S35-infected cells
2474852:Click here for file This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research.
2474852:Furthermore, persistent activation of ERK signaling up-regulates TDAG51
2474852:Anchorage-independent growth often predicts the ability of cells to grow as xenografted tumors in immuno-compromised mice
2474852:When grown under anchorage-independent conditions in ultra-low attachment plates, the accumulation of cells for the various infected cell lines roughly paralleled the total cell masses seen in soft agar growth assays (Figure 2C )
2474852:Sub-G1 peaks indicative of dead cells were sometimes seen with cell cycle analysis at late time points, but varied from experiment to experiment
2474852:The importance of TDAG51 regulation on the transformed phenotype of Ras-infected cells was addressed using TDAG51-specific interfering small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to reduce TDAG51 levels
2474852:Patterns of differential gene expression have been used for classification and prognostication of certain cancers and may be valuable for prospectively predicting responsiveness to therapeutic treatments [ 1 ]
2474852:Cell lines were grown in the presence of DMSO vehicle or 0.25 ?M PD153035 for 48 hours, followed by western blotting for phosphorylated Erk (Phospho-Erk)
2474852:Finally, TDAG51 acts in a suppressive manner during matrix-detached growth of HME16C cells
2474852:Polyclonal populations of pLRT infected cells were selected with 5 ?g/mL blasticidin
2474852:Cells grown under anchorage-independent conditions were spun down, washed once in sterile PBS, and suspended in a 50% mixture of PBS and ACCUMAX cell detachment solution (Chemicon International) for 10 minutes at 25�C to dissociate cell clumps
2474852:Labeled cDNA was hybridized to long-oligo (70-mer) cDNA microarrays from the NCI/CCR Microarray Center, NCI, Frederick, MD, according to standard protocols [ 25 ]
2474852:Consistent with this observation, inhibition of MEK, and therefore ERK signaling, using the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059 at 10 ?M, significantly inhibited soft agar colony formation by all cell lines (not shown)
2474852:Similar experiments to that shown was performed 1 additional time with similar results
2474852:It has been hypothesized that HMLE human mammary epithelial cells represent a distinct precursor population from those mammary epithelial cells that give rise to glandular adenocarcinomas, the predominant form of breast cancer [ 32 ]
2474852:Up-regulation of the PHLDA1 gene product, TDAG51, was found to correlate with persistent ERK activation and anchorage-independent growth in the absence or presence of EGFR inhibition
2474852:Constructs for the inducible expression of H-Ras, H-Ras effector domain mutants, and Rlf-CAAX were created by PCR subcloning the sequences of HA-tagged H-RasG12V (RasV12), H-RasG12V, E37G (RasV12G37), H-RasG12V, T35S (RasV12S35), H-RasG12V, Y40C (RasV12C40), and Rlf-CAAX [ 21 ] into the tetracycline-inducible retroviral expression vector pLRT [ 22 ]
2474852:Appropriately-supplememented fresh media was added to wells every 4 days
2474852:As shown in Figure 3C , EGFR inhibition significantly reduced ERK signaling in RasV12G37- and RasV12C40-infected cells without affecting RasV12- and RasV12S35-infected cells
2474852:Ras activation is a common intermediary in signaling pathways initiated by a variety of cell surface receptors, and signaling pathways downstream of Ras have been implicated repeatedly in oncogenesis
2474852:Reducing TDAG51 protein levels in ERK-driven cellular transformation enhanced cell growth under anchorage-independent, but not attached, conditions
2474852:After filtering and normalization, the Cy3 and Cy5 values were expressed as a ratio to indicate the fold up- or down-regulation
2474852:Sequences of primers used for real-time RT-PCR analysis are as follows: amphiregulin Forward 5'-CGCCGGTGGTGCTGTCGCTCTT-3' Reverse 5'-TCACTCACAGGGGAAATCTCACTC-3', anterior gradient 2 Forward 5'-GGGGTGACCAACTCATCTGGACTCAG-3' Reverse 5'-GACATACTGGCCATCAGGAGAAAGGTGT-3', CD24 Forward 5'-GCTCCTACCCACGCAGATTTATT-3' Reverse 5'-CACGAAGAGACTGGCTGTTGACT-3', c-met Forward 5'-AAATGGCCACGGGACAACACAA-3' Reverse 5'-TGGGCTGGGGTATAACATTCAAGA-3', CTGF Forward 5'-CTGCCCGGGAAATGCTGCGAGGAGT-3' Reverse 5'-CTGCAGGAGGCGTTGTCATTGGTAA-3', CYR61 Forward 5'-CGGCCCAAGTACTGCGGTTCCT-3' Reverse 5'-ATTGGCATGCGGGCAGTTGTAGTT-3', Decorin Forward 5'-ACTTCTGCCCACCTGGACACAACA-3' Reverse 5'-ATGGCAGAGCGCACGTAGACACA-3', DICER-1 Forward 5'-CAGGAAATACCCGTGCAACCAACTA-3' Reverse 5'-GCATTACGGCCATCACAGGACTTC-3', E-cadherin Forward 5'-GGTATCTTCCCCGCCCTGCCAATCC-3' Reverse 5'-AACCGCTTCCTTCATAGTCAAACACGAG-3', EphA2 Forward 5'-CCCCTTCCGCCCCACACTACCTCACAGC-3' Reverse 5'-ACACGGCCCGCATTCCCCAGACTCG-3', Epiregulin Forward 5'-TTGTATTTTTAGTAGAGGCGGGGTTTCA-3' Reverse 5'-TCGGGCACAGATGTTCAAGTCAC-3', ETS-1 Forward 5'-ACTCGGGGGCCAGGACTCTTTTGAA-3' Reverse 5'-CACGGTCCCGCACATAGTCCTTGAA-3', ETS variant gene 5 Forward 5'-TCGGGGACGTCTACGGTTTCTACT-3' Reverse 5'-AAGACTGTAAACGGCTACCATTGA-3', FAT-2 Forward 5'-GCTGGACATCAAACGGGCTAACAT-3' Reverse 5'-ACCGCATCTGAACCCCCACTGAAT-3', HMGA-1 Forward 5'-GCTCACCCTGCCCGCTCCCAACC-3' Reverse 5'-GCCCCAGCCCCTCTTCCCCACAAA-3', HMGA-2 Forward 5'-CTGATAAGCAAGAGTGGGCGGGTGAGAA-3' Reverse 5'-ACAGGGAGTGGGTTGGGGTGGTATTTGA-3', Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 Forward 5'-CCCGCTCCCTTTCCCTCCATA-3' Reverse 5'-GCTCTCACTTTCCGCCCAATCC-3', Tenascin C Forward 5'-GCGGCCCAGAGCGAGGAA-3' Reverse 5'-TATTGCGATGTTGTCACTGGGAGATTTT-3', TGF-a Forward 5'-CCGCCTTGGTGGTGGTCTCC-3' Reverse 5'-AGGGCGCTGGGCTTCTCGTG-3', TGF-?2 Forward 5'-CCCGCCCACTTTCTACAGACCCTACT-3' Reverse 5'-CATTCGCCTTCTGCTCTTGTTTTCAC-3', TGF-? receptor 2 Forward 5'-ACAGTGGCAGTCAAGATCTTTCCCTATG-3' Reverse 5'-CAACTCCGTCTTCCGCTCCTCAG-3', TRIM29 Forward 5'-ATGCATGCGCCACGTTGAGAAGAT-3' Reverse 5'-GGTGAAGCGGCCAGGAGACGAG-3'
2474852:To assess transformation by different Ras signaling pathways, anchorage-independent growth assays were performed in soft agar and in ultra-low attachment tissue culture plates
2474852:Fold expression of each band relative to HME16C pLRT pLVTHM: pLRT pLVTHM (1.0), 36-1 (0.4); V12 pLVTHM (2.3), 36-1 (1.0); S35 pLVTHM (1.5), 36-1 (0.7)
2474852:Numbers represent fold expression changes for transcript levels relative to vector-infected pLRT control cells
2474852:However, another important component of ERK activation is the dual specific ERK phosphatases, a highly regulated class of proteins, whose relative level of activity may be affected by TDAG51 protein levels
2474852:In concordance with these results, RasV12S35 and RasV12 cells expressing the TDAG51-specific shRNA showed enhanced incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) in cell proliferation assays, indicating a higher rate of DNA synthesis in cells with reduced TDAG51 protein (Figure 7C )
2474852:Signal intensities for an entire microarray were normalized to the 50% percentile median value
2474852:Activation of both the ERK and PI3K signaling pathways was sufficient to induce cellular transformation, which was accompanied by up-regulation of EGFR ligands, suggesting autocrine EGFR stimulation during the transformation process
2474852:Likewise, the protein product of the PHLDA1 gene, TDAG51, displayed an identical expression pattern
2474852:HME16C human mammary cells [ 19 ] were cultured in Clonetics Mammary Epithelial Basal Media (MEBM) with MEGM SingleQuot supplements (Cambrex), and HEK-HT human embryonic kidney epithelial cells [ 20 ] in DMEM (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen)
2474852:Conception and design: MDO and KK
2474852:In this and subsequent figures, cells infected with the following vectors are indicated as follows: pLRT control (pLRT), H-RasV12 (V12), H-RasV12G37 (G37), H-RasV12S35 (S35), H-RasV12C40 (C40), and Rlf-CAAX (Rlf-CAAX)
2474852:Fold expression relative to DMSO-treated pLRT: pLRT -(1.0), +(0.2); V12 -(2.3), +(2.6); G37 -(0.8), +(0.3); S35 -(1.4), +(0.9); C40 -(1.1), +(0.6); Rlf-CAAX -(1.6), +(1.0)
2474852:Taken together, these findings suggest that breast cancer is a relevant model in which to study the biology of downstream Ras signal transduction
2474852:In fact, the immortalized human breast epithelial cell line HMLE required simultaneous activation of Raf, PI3K, and the RalGEF pathways for maximal anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenic transformation [ 14 ]
2474852:Results are for transcripts identified as up- or down-regulated in microarray analysis of cDNA from RasV12-, RasV12G37-, RasV12S35-, RasV12C40-, and Rlf-CAAX-infected HME16C
2474852:Prior to cell plating, 250 ng/mL doxycycline, DMSO vehicle, or the anti-EGFR compound PD153035 (Calbiochem), was added to the agar, as appropriate
2474852:The development and progression of breast cancer is the result of multiple genetic changes, which lead to complex alterations in signal transduction networks in breast cancer cells relative to their normal epithelial counterparts
2474852:Of the other cell lines tested, only the RasV12S35-infected HME16C cells formed palpable tumors in 50% of injected animals with an average latency of approximately 12 weeks and a mean tumor volume of 109.0 mm3 at 16 weeks, considerably smaller than RasV12-expressing tumors (Table 1 )
2474852:The preliminary finding that TDAG51 binds to proteins involved in protein translation has been used to suggest that TDAG51 may play a role in regulating protein synthesis in response to proteotoxic stress [ 40 ]
2474852:EGFR signaling is frequently altered in breast cancer, where EGFR and ErbB2 over-expression are common events
2474852:Provision of study materials: MDO, JJY, YW, and KK
2474852:Analysis of activated, GTP-bound Ral A demonstrated highly elevated levels of activated Ral A only in Rlf-CAAX-expressing cells and not in Ras-infected cells grown under standard culture conditions (Figure 1B )
2474852:However, cell growth under anchorage-independent conditions in ultra-low attachment plates was significantly enhanced by TDAG51 knock-down in RasV12S35-infected cells (Figure 6B )
2474852:Hybridized arrays were analyzed using a GenePix 4000B array scanner and GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices Corporation)
2474852:(A) Expression of HA-tagged H-RasV12, H-RasV12 effector domain mutants, and Rlf-CAAX in HME16C mammary epithelial cells
2474852:This suggests that Ras signaling pathways other than ERK compensate partially for the negative growth effects of TDAG51, or that RasV12-infected cells are already close to maximally transformed under anchorage-independent growth conditions
2474852:The ability of activated Ras and Raf to induce autocrine expression of epidermal-like growth factors has been implicated in the protection of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells from anoikis [ 16 ]
2474852:Expression of exogenous H-Ras and Rlf-CAAX, and activation of endogenous RalA, in this cell line was similar to that observed in HME16C cells (not shown)
2474852:Band intensities were determined using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and TDAG51 values were normalized using alpha tubulin values
2474852:Overexpression of TDAG51 has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and induce cell death in a variety of cell types including T cells, neuronal, endothelial, melanoma, and cervical carcinoma cell types [ 34 , 35 , 38 ]
2474852:To validate gene expression changes identified by cDNA microarray analysis, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using RNA from the same samples used in microarray analysis, and is presented in Additional file 2 
2474852:The metastatic potential of RasV12- and RasV12G37-expressing cell lines was tested by tail-vein injection in nude mice, but no metastatic lesions were observed by histological analysis in lungs, liver, spleen, or kidneys at 16 weeks post injection (not shown)
2474852:Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post-tests using the GraphPad Prism software program (GraphPad Software, Inc.)
2474852:(B) Relative LDH activity released by pLVTHM- or anti-TDAG51 shRNA 36-1-infected RasV12 cells
2474852:Activation of the Ras oncogene is accompanied by the stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the activation or repression of numerous transcription factors as well as changes in mRNA translation and stability, and thus, the modulation of gene expression
2474852:To test whether TDAG51 might affect proximal ERK signaling, we examined the activation status of Erk in cells expressing TDAG51-specific shRNA
2474852:Ras- and Ras EDM-infected HME16C cells formed significantly more soft agar colonies >100 ?m in diameter than pLRT vector-infected cells (Figure 2A )
2474852:To confirm that TDAG51 up-regulation was induced specifically by ERK activation, we treated pLRT-, RasV12-, and RasV12S35-infected cells with the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059
2474852:Interestingly, the levels of phosphorylated Erk were enhanced when TDAG51 protein levels were reduced in RasV12S35 and RasV12 cells grown under anchorage-independent, but not attached, conditions (Figure 9 )
2474852:Collection and assembly of data: MDO, SJB, and LZ
2474852:Microarray analyses identified up-regulation of the PHLDA1 gene product as being correlated with ERK-mediated cellular transformation
2474852:After dissociation, cells were washed once in cold PBS and then fixed with 70% ethanol
2474852:In addition, ligands for the EGFR such as transforming growth factor-a, amphiregulin, epiregulin, betacellulin, and heparin-binding EGF stimulate the receptor in primary breast tumors to enhance local growth and progression of the disease [ 8 ]
2474852:The presence of EGFR was established using Western blots (not shown)
2474852:To analyze the role of TDAG51 in ERK-dependent growth, we reduced TDAG51 expression in RasV12- and RasV12S35-infected cells to a level comparable to that in non-transformed vector-infected control cells using stably expressed TDAG51-specific shRNA (Figure 6A )
2474852:The blot was subsequently stripped and probed with an anti-alpha tubulin mAb (Alpha tubulin)
2474852:We determined that ERK but not PI3K or RalGEF activation of HMEC16C cells supports anchorage independent proliferation independent of EGFR activation
2474852:Reduction of TDAG51 expression in Ras V12 and Ras V12S35-infected cells and their anchorage-independent growth 
2474852:Bar represents 200 ?m
2474852:To compare our results to others, we verified the function of pLRT vector driven Ras EDM mutants and Rlf-CAAX in HEK-HT cells, which previously have been reported to form colonies in soft agar upon expression of H-RasV12G37 and Rlf-CAAX [ 27 ]
2474852:Using FlowJo flow cytometry software (Tree Star, Inc.), DMSO-treated control cells were used to determine the threshold above which cells could be considered EdU positive, and the fraction of cells incorporating EdU was then determined for experimental samples
2474852:RasV12 or RasV12S35 cells infected with either pLVTHM vector control or anti-TDAG51 shRNA 36-1 were grown for 72 hours attached to tissue culture plastic (attached) or in ultra-low attachment plates (anchorage-independent) in the presence of 250 ng/mL doxycycline
2474852:However, it should be noted that Ras-transformed HME16C, as well as the similar HMLER [ 32 ], give rise to squamous metaplasias and not adenocarcinomas
2474852:Colonies greater than 100 ?m in diameter were counted after 18 days using a 2� lens equipped with a graded grid to determine colony size
2474852:Ras mutations are rare in breast cancer, where the mutation rate is less than 5% [ 3 ]
2474852:Complete inhibition of colony formation for RasV12G37-infected and RasV12C40-infected cells was observed at 0.25 ?M PD153035, a concentration that specifically inhibits EGFR [ 28 ], whereas both the RasV12- and RasV12S35-infected cells formed colonies efficiently at this same concentration of inhibitor (Figure 3A and 3B )
2474852:Results for 22 of 26 genes chosen to reflect genes up- or down-regulated both strongly or weakly showed strong agreement with microarray data, demonstrating that the microarray dataset represents a reliable quantification of gene expression changes
2474852:Microarray analyses of RasV12 and Ras effector domain mutant transduced cells demonstrated a common upregulation of EGFR ligands among transformed cell lines
2474852:Taken together with the identification of TDAG51 as a stress-induced gene in a variety of cell lines and a growth inhibitor in melanoma cell lines, it is reasonable to suggest that loss of TDAG51 may act to promote progression of breast cancer through an intrinsic growth regulatory mechanism
2474852:Reduction of TDAG51 levels in RasV12 and RasV12S35 cells enhanced cell proliferation under anchorage-independent conditions
2474852:Minimal information about a microarray experiment (MIAME)-compliant microarray data has been deposited with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus, accession number GSE8916, available at [ 26 ]
2474852:[ 31 ]
2474852:We performed a functional analysis of one gene in particular, TDAG51, whose expression is regulated by ERK through EGFR dependent and independent mechanisms
2474852:Histological analysis of H&E stained tumor sections revealed poorly differentiated spindle-shaped tumor cells with prominent squamous cell differentiation and extracellular keratin deposition (not shown)
2474852:Studies using immortalized mouse EpH4 mammary epithelial cells have implicated Raf as well as PI3K pathways in supporting transformation and tumorigenesis [ 13 ]
2474852:These Ras EDMs, together with activated or dominant-negative versions of downstream effectors, have been used to characterize the pathways that contribute to the transformation of immortalized cells
2474852:Here we investigated which signal transduction pathways downstream of Ras contribute to EGFR-dependent transformation of telomerase-immortalized mammary epithelial cells HME16C
2474852:(B) Representative pictures of colony sizes in soft agar assays
2474852:* p < 0.05
2474852:The release of lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) into cell culture supernatant was measured using the cytotoxicity detection kit LDH (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions
2474852:Since cell growth under anchorage-independent conditions is a balance between cell proliferation and cell death, we sought to evaluate the effect upon cellular death of TDAG51 knock-down
2474852:(A) Relative LDH activity released by pLVTHM- or anti-TDAG51 shRNA 36-1-infected RasV12S35 cells was measured in the culture media of cells grown under anchorage-independent conditions in ultra-low attachment plates for the times indicated
2474852:The fact that the activation status of Erk was unchanged in cells grown under attached conditions suggests that reducing TDAG51 expression had no selective effect with regard to ERK activation in these cells
2474852:(A) Twenty-five micrograms of protein from HME16C cellular lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with an anti-TDAG51 monoclonal antibody (TDAG51)
2474852:Among the Ras EDM-infected cells, the RasV12S35-infected cells formed the largest colonies
2474852:The specificity of product synthesis was verified by melting curve analysis by the Rotor-Gene 5.0.37 software, and by running of real-time PCR products on 2% agarose gels to verify product size and rule out primer-dimer contribution to calculated values
2474852:Fixed cells were treated with RNAse A for 20 minutes at 37�C, and nuclear DNA was stained with 50 ?g/mL propidium iodide at 4�C
2474852:The RasV12-infected HME16C cells formed rapidly growing, fluid-filled tumors with an average latency of 4 weeks and a mean tumor volume of 808.8 mm3 at 6 weeks (Table 1 )
2474852:* p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
2474852:How TDAG51 expression might suppress ERK signaling is not known, but appears to represent a negative feedback pathway that directly or indirectly limits ERK activation
2474852:Final approval of manuscript: MDO, SJB, LZ, JJY, YW, and KK
2474852:(C) Akt activation in cell lysates was assessed by western blotting for phosphorylated Akt (Phospho-Akt)
2474852:Rlf-CAAX-infected cells formed slightly more colonies above 100 ?m than vector-transfected control cells, but these were significantly smaller than those formed by Ras- and Ras EDM-infected cells
2474852:The HME16C cells maintained viability but did not increase in number
2474852:Western blotting of TDAG51 in HME16C cell lines
2474852:The generation of retroviruses and lentiviruses was as described [ 23 ]
2474852:Anchorage-independent growth of HME16C cell lines 
2474852:To determine which gene expression changes accompany the transformation of HME16C human epithelial cells by activated Ras, we examined our transformed HME16C cells by cDNA microarray analysis
2474852:(A) S phase fraction of RasV12S35-expressing (left panel) or RasV12-expressing (right panel) HME16C infected with pLVTHM non-silencing vector control or anti-TDAG51 shRNA 36-1 after 48, 72, 96 or 120 hours growth in ultra-low attachment plates as determined by cell cycle analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei
2474852:At the times indicated, 50 ?L of alamar blue (BioSource International) was added to each well and incubated for 6 hours under standard culture conditions
2474852:Western blotting confirmed that TDAG51 was also upregulated in a similar manner (Figure 4A )
2474852:Quantification of relative cDNA levels for each gene was accomplished using the Platinum� SYBR� Green qPCR Supermix UDG real-time RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and a Rotor-Gene3000� thermocycler with Rotor-Gene 5.0.37 software (Corbett Research) that calculates relative PCR synthesis rates by comparative quantification
2474852:Interestingly, a decrease in TDAG51 expression during Ras-mediated cellular transformation promoted the growth of cells under anchorage-independent conditions but did not affect the growth of attached cells
2474852:Furthermore, we examined whether a highly transcriptionally regulated ERK pathway target, PHLDA1 (TDAG51), suggested to be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and melanoma, might modulate the transformation process
2474852:The loss of TDAG51 mRNA and protein has been correlated with breast adenocarcinoma and melanoma progression in clinical samples [ 17 , 18 ]
2474852:Similar results have been found in a small series of melanomas, where TDAG51 immunoreactivity was found to decrease during the progression of melanocytic nevi to primary melanomas and finally to metastatic melanoma [ 18 ]
2474852:For determining gene expression changes greater than or less than 2-fold, data sets were filtered for genes containing at least two significant values out of four array sets
2474852:The blot was stripped and subsequently probed with an anti-Erk2 mAb (Erk2)
2474852:It was determined that TDAG51-specific shRNA did not affect the redox potential of HME16C at various cell numbers
2474852:Both RasV12S35- and RasV12- TDAG51 shRNA-expressing cells demonstrated an increased S-phase fraction versus pLVTHM vector control cells at various time points during anchorage-independent growth (Figure 7A )
2474852:(C) Activation of Erk after EGFR inhibition
2474852:Rather, the enhanced activation of Erk was specific to anchorage-independent growth conditions
2474852:After infection, cells with integrated lentivirus were selected by sterile sorting for GFP
2474852:Incorporated EdU was quantified by detection of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled EdU in viable single cells by flow cytometry analysis
2474852:Reduction of TDAG51 expression resulted in an increase in Erk activation in cells grown under anchorage-independent conditions
2474852:cDNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis of HME16C RasV12- and Ras EDM-infected cells (Additional file 1 ) revealed increased levels of mRNAs for EGFR ligands, including epiregulin, amphiregulin, and TGFa (Table 2 )
2474852:Tumor formation was assessed following subcutaneous inoculation
2474852:Fold expression of each band relative to HME16C parental: HME16C parental, 1.0; pLRT, 1.0; V12, 3.0; G37, 2.3; S35, 2.4; C40, 1.3; Rlf-CAAX, 0.9
2474852:In vitro studies have suggested a role for TDAG51 in the control of cellular proliferation and in the induction of apoptosis in response to a variety of stresses including proteotoxic cellular stresses such as lung cancer cell responses to chemotherapy[ 35 , 37 - 39 ]
2474852:PHLDA1 is categorized as an up-regulated gene under "Miscellaneous." Click here for file Real-time RT-PCR confirmation of selected microarray data 
2474852:This is not likely to be due to an inhibition of ERK protein synthesis by TDAG51, since Erk2 levels were unaffected by reduced TDAG51
2474852:EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; ErbB2: epidermal growth factor receptor family member B2; Erk: extracellular regulated kinase; PHDLA1: pleckstrin homology domain-like, family A, member 1; PI3K: phsphatidyl inositol 3-kinase; PIK3CA: phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10; Ral: ras-like gene; RalGEF: Ral guanidine nucleotide exchange factor; Rlf: RalGEF-like factor; shRNA: small hairpin ribonucleic acid; TDAG51: T-cell death associated gene of 51 kDa
2474852:The contents have not been published by or submitted to any other journal
2474852:The expression of the anti-TDAG51 shRNA 36-1 was accomplished by sub-cloning the anti-TDAG51 shRNA sequence 5'-GGAACTGCACTTCTCCAACTTCAAGAGAGTTGGAGAAGTGCAGTTCCTTTTT-3' into the pLVTHM lentivirus (kindly provided by Dr
2474852:Three sterile sorts were performed to acquire a polyclonal population of cells exclusively expressing GFP that was subsequently examined for TDAG51 protein reduction by western blotting
2474852:Almost all Ras and Ras EDM-induced upregulated transcriptional responses were blocked by pharmacological inhibition of EGFR, consistent with previous reports for inhibition of Raf-regulated transcription [ 30 ]
2474852:Parenthetical numbers indicate mean fold expression changes from cDNA microarray analysis (see Additional file above)
2474852:Similar experiments to that shown were performed 2 additional times with similar results
2474852:The PHLDA1 gene is of interest as it has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor in breast adenocarcinoma and melanoma [ 17 , 18 ]
2474852:Cells were trypsinized, neutralized, and 1.2 � 104 cells were plated per well in 0.36% bacto-agar (BD Biosciences), w/v in growth media, on a 0.6% bacto-agar support in 6-well culture plates
2474852:To do this, RNA was isolated from H-RasV12 and H-RasV12 EDM expressing cells after treatment with doxycycline to fully induce gene expression and compared to RNA from identically treated pLRT vector-infected control cells
2474852:Expression of TDAG51 in HME16C cell lines in the absence or presence of the EGFR inibition 
2474852:Cell proliferation is increased in Ras-transformed cell lines with reduced TDAG51 expression 
2474852:Following blockade of EGFR signaling with the EGFR-specific inhibitor PD153035, the only pathway downstream of Ras that promoted anchorage-independent growth was Raf/ERK, suggesting that Raf activation was able to substitute for EGFR activity in this cell line
2474852:Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) after treatment of cells with 250 ng/mL doxycycline for 72 hours to induce gene expression, or with doxycycline and 0.25 ?M EGFR receptor kinase inhibitor PD153035 as indicated
2474852:Up-regulation of TDAG51 occurs during Ras-mediated transformation in an ERK-dependent fashion, but opposes ERK-mediated transformation by suppressing ERK signaling and decreasing cellular proliferation under matrix-detached conditions
2474852:Using HMEC16C cells, a telomerase-immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line, we have investigated the contribution of EGFR signaling to anchorage-independent growth initiated by Raf and additional signaling pathways downstream of Ras
2474852:PHDLA1 has been described as an immediate early gene with transcriptional activation resulting from engagement of receptors such as the FGF and IGF tyrosine kinase receptors and the T-cell receptor [ 34 - 36 ]
2474852:RFU, relative fluorescence units of alamar blue product formed
2474852:Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test analysis
2474852:LDH release was increased by TDAG51 shRNA-expressing RasV12S35 cells relative to pLVTHM-infected cells at various time points after the initiation of matrix-detached growth (Figure 8 )
2474852:(A) Cell lines, as indicated, were grown in the soft agar assay for 21 days either in the presence of DMSO vehicle or 0.25 ?M PD153035 EGFR inhibitor
2474852:Data analysis and interpretation: MDO and KK
2474852:Therefore, PHLDA1 represents a Raf/ERK-responsive gene whose expression parallels EGFR-independent HME16C mammary epithelial cell transformation
2474852:The sequence-specific primers used in real-time RT-PCR can be found in Additional file 2 
2474852:The Ras oncogene binds numerous effectors that in turn activate a variety of signaling pathways
2474852:(B) Number of colonies >100 ?m in size for each cell line treated with either DMSO vehicle or 0.25 ?M of the EGFR-specific inhibitor PD153035
2474852:This suggested that autocrine EGFR ligand secretion was an important component of Ras-mediated cellular transformation
2474852:The studies here measure a proliferative response of Raf/ERK activation in the absence of a strong apoptotic component
2474852:Approximately one-half of the tumors were aspirated prior to sacrifice, and a sero-sanguinous fluid was observed, on average accounting for roughly one-third of the measured tumor volume
2474852:For human immortalized mammary epithelial cells, Raf and PI3K clearly contribute to transformation, although each is usually not sufficient for tumor formation in animal models [ 14 , 15 ]
2474852:Signaling differences between tumor and normal cells are reflected in altered gene expression patterns, a finding that has been widely investigated using various molecular techniques
2474852:Anchorage-independent growth of HME16C cell lines after EGFR inhibition 
2474852:Measurement of cell proliferation by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation was measured using the Click-iT EdU cell proliferation Assay Kit for Flow Cytometry (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol
2474852:The dissection of individual Ras signaling pathways is possible using effector domain mutants (EDMs) of Ras, for which single amino acid mutations in the effector binding domain allow the binding and activation of specific effectors, but not others [ 12 ]
2474852:Our results suggest that multiple Ras signal transduction pathways contribute to mammary epithelial cell transformation, but that the ERK signaling pathway may be a crucial component downstream of EGFR activation during tumorigenesis
2474852:By comparison, PHLDA1 was down-regulated in PD153035-treated RasV12G37 relative to vehicle-treated cells (not shown)
2474852:The final text was reviewed and approved by all the listed co-authors
2474852:Fold expression of PD98059-treated relative to DMSO-treated contols: pLRT (0.6); V12 (0.6); S35 (0.3)
2474852:Total Ral A protein from lysates used in the Ral activation assay pull-down was determined by anti-Ral A western blotting (Ral A)
2474852:Tumorigenicity assays were done essentially as described [ 23 ]
2474852:Similarly, treatment of cells grown in ultra-low-attachment plates also demonstrated that EGFR inhibition substantially inhibited growth of RasV12G37-and RasV12C40-expressing cells relative to that of RasV12- and RasV12S35-expressing HME16C (Figure 2C )
2474852:In addition to enhancing cellular proliferation, reduction of TDAG51 protein levels also increased the absolute amount of cell death in transformed RasV12S35 cells under these same conditions
2474852:All cells were maintained at 37�C and 5% CO2
2474852:Empty vector-, RasV12G37-, RasV12C40-, and Rlf-CAAX-infected cells failed to form palpable tumors four months after injection
2474852:Cell proliferation of attached cells grown on tissue culture plastic was unaffected by lowered TDAG51 protein levels (not shown)
2474852:Other studies also have implicated TDAG51 in functioning during cellular stress and survival, particularly endoplasmic reticulum stress associated with the unfolded protein response [ 37 , 38 ]
2474852:Briefly, cells were plated at 1 � 106 cells per well in 6-well ultra-low attachment plates or 5 � 105 cells per dish in 60 mm tissue culture dishes for attached control cells
2474852:Signal intensities of microarray features were calculated by subtracting the median local background from the median signal intensity
2474852:Protein expression and pathway activation in HME16C cell lines 
2474852:RFU, relative fluorescence units
2474852:Cellular transformation of human mammary epithelial cells by downstream Ras signal transduction pathways was examined using anchorage-independent growth assays in the presence and absence of EGFR inhibition
2474852:cDNA was synthesized from RNA obtained for microarray analysis using the SuperScript� III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen)
2474852:(B) HME16C cell lines were treated with DMSO vehicle or 0.25 ?M PD153035 EGFR-specific inhibitor for 48 hours, and cell lysates were prepared
2474852:Western blots were performed using Chemilluminescence (Pierce)
2474852:The authors declare that they have no competing interests
2474852:(A) Number of soft agar colonies exceeding 100 ?M after 21 days of growth for HME16C cell lines infected with pLRT control, H-RasV12, H-RasV12G37, H-RasV12S35, H-RasV12C40, and Rlf-CAAX-expressing constructs
2474852:EGFR and ErbB2 receptor over-expression occurs in one quarter to one-half of all breast tumors, and this correlates with a significantly decreased disease-free and overall survival rates [ 5 , 7 ]
2474852:For Ral activation assays, the Ral Activation Assay Kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol
2474852:Signaling downstream of Ras is mediated by three major pathways, Raf/ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), and Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RalGEF)
2474852:In mammary epithelial cells, both species- as well as cell line-dependent differences in Ras downstream signaling pathways have been found to induce tumorigenesis and/or anchorage-independent growth, a measure of in vitro transformation
2474852:(C) Anchorage-independent growth of cell lines grown on ultra-low attachment plates treated with DMSO vehicle (left) or 0.25 ?M PD153035 (right) measured using the alamar blue assay
2474852:Using TDAG51 immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays, 699 individual primary invasive breast tumor specimens were examined; loss of TDAG51 was found to correlate with a poorer disease-free and overall survival rate in multivariate analysis
2474852:The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:  Selected microarray data for HME16C cell lines 
2474852:NS, not significant, p > 0.05; *, p < 0.0001
2474852:Our analysis identified PHLDA1 as an up-regulated gene in both vehicle-treated and PD153035-treated RasV12 and RasV12S35 cells, although the relative fold increase was reduced following EGFR inhibition
2474852:Statistical analysis of microarray (SAM) data analysis was performed for the datasets, and a delta value of 0.4 was chosen for each dataset, which maintains the estimated false discovery rate (FDR) below 1% for each
2474852:The PHLDA1 gene is a member of the pleckstrin homology-related domain family that includes Ipl/Tssc and Tih [ 33 ]
2474852:The significantly reduced tumorigenicity of RasV12S35- as compared to RasV12- expressing cells emphasizes the importance of cooperation between Ras signal transduction pathways for a fully transformed phenotype
2474852:DMSO-treated cells are indicated by a -, and PD1535035-treated cells are indicated by a +
2474852:Therefore, we sought to determine if autocrine signaling by the EGFR was required for the anchorage-independent growth of Ras- or Ras EDM-infected cells
2474852:To characterize the effect of TDAG51 on cell proliferation under anchorage-independent conditions, cell cycle analysis and cell proliferation assays for RasV12S35- and RasV12-infected cells were performed
2474852:LDH release by Ras V12S35- or Ras V12-expressing HME16C infected with pLVTHM vector or anti-TDAG51 shRNA 36-1 
2474852:In this study, we used the hTERT-immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line HME16C to examine which Ras signaling pathways are sufficient for transformation and to identify transcriptional targets downstream of those pathways that might modulate this phenotype
2474852:This event serves as a negative regulator of both Erk activation as well as matrix-detached cellular proliferation and suggests that TDAG51 opposes ERK-mediated transformation in breast epithelial cells
2474852:In addition to serving as biomarkers, some differentially expressed gene products have been informative in defining the physiological differences between normal and cancer cells
2474852:Cells within RasV12S35-infected tumors resembled the histology of RasV12 tumor cells but with less keratin deposition and without the formation of fluid-filled spaces (not shown)
2474852:In addition, increased levels of phospho-Erk were unexpectedly seen in RasV12G37- and RasV12C40-infected cells, possibly the result of autocrine activation of endogenous EGFR by secreted EGFR ligands
2474852:Microarray analysis identified the PHLDA1 gene as being dramatically up-regulated in RasV12- and Ras EDM-infected cells to levels that correlated with the level of ERK activation and the extent of anchorage-independent growth (Additional file 1 )
2474852:To evaluate the effect of EGFR inhibition on gene expression, RasV12-, RasV12S35-, and RasV12G37-infected cells were induced with doxycycline and subsequently incubated either in the presence or absence of 0.25 ?M PD153035, and microarray analysis comparisons were made to vehicle-treated pLRT-infected cells
2474852:TDAG51 therefore represents an ERK-inducible gene whose up-regulation in HME16C is correlated with an EGFR-independent, ERK-mediated transformation
2474852:Expression of activated Ras effector domain mutants that bind Raf, PI3K, or RalGEF are sufficient to induce the anchorage-independent growth of the human mammary epithelial cell line HME16C and are associated with up-regulation of EGFR ligands
2474852:The RasV12-infected cells formed large colonies, many exceeding 1000 ?m, although the total number exceeding 100 ?m was typically less than that for the Ras EDM (Figure 2B )
2474852:Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post tests using the GraphPad Prism software program (GraphPad Software, Inc.)
2474852:Manuscript writing: MDO and KK
2474852:Therefore, in this model of mammary epithelial cell transformation, TDAG51 acts as a growth inhibitor of ERK-driven proliferation and may help explain why loss of TDAG51 expression has been found to correlate with progression in human breast cancer and melanoma
2474852:Scale bar, 200 ?m
2474852:Understanding the mechanisms by which TDAG51 regulates ERK pathway activation and the balance between cellular proliferation and apoptosis of transformed cells represents a future challenge
2474852:Prior to filtering, all data points were analyzed using statistical analysis of microarray (SAM) data and a resultant gene set was chosen at a delta value of 0.4 that limited the false discovery rate (number of predicted false positive values/number of significant genes) for each analysis to less than 1%
2474852:The blot was subsequently stripped and probed with an alpha tubulin mAb (Alpha tubulin)
2474852:The difference in LDH release for TDAG51 shRNA-expressing RasV12 cells was minimal and rarely approached statistical significance
2474852:However, Ras signaling is hyperactive in many primary breast tumors [ 4 ]
2474852:However, only the ERK pathway is capable of supporting transformation in the absence of EGFR signaling and of supporting tumorigenesis in nude mice
2474852:This is most likely due to the activation of growth factor receptors that activate Ras exchange factors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR (ErbB1) and ErbB2 (HER2/neu) and the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor c-fms [ 5 , 6 ]
2474852:Ras proteins are frequently mutated to an activated form in human cancers, particularly in tumors of the pancreas, colon, thyroid, and lung [ 2 ]
2474852:The amount of alamar blue reduction was quantified by measuring the fluorescence of each sample at 530 nm excitation/590 nm emission, corrected for the background fluorescence in wells containing media but no cells
2474852:Twenty micrograms of RNA were used for cDNA generation, and cDNA labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 monofunctional reactive dye to amino allyl-modified dUTP incorporated into cDNA using the FairPlay Microarray labeling kit (Stratagene)
2474852:Equal protein loading was verified by stripping the blot and probing with an alpha tubulin monoclonal antibody (Alpha tubulin)
2474852:Therefore, for RasV12S35-infected cells, the differences in cell growth after TDAG51 reduction under anchorage-independent conditions resulted from an enhanced rate of cellular proliferation that exceeded a concomitant increase in cell death
2474852:TDAG51 expression is induced by ERK pathway activation 
2474852:Erk activation was determined by western blotting for phosphorylated Erk (Phospho-Erk)
2474852:No part of this text has been included in any other paper
2474852:The membrane was stripped and probed with an anti-Akt antibody (Total Akt)
2474852:ERK pathway activation was measured by determination of phosphorylated Erk1/2 levels by western blotting using an anti-phosphorylated Erk mAb (phospho-Erk)
2474852:PD98059 used at 20 ?M appears to be specific for MEK1 as it does not nonspecifically inhibit a variety of other protein kinases that have been assayed
2474852:Antibodies used for western blots included anti-Ras mAb (BD Biosciences, cat#R02120), rat anti-HA mAb (Roche, cat#1988506), anti-phospho Erk mAb (Santa Cruz, cat#sc-7383), goat anti- Erk2 (Santa Cruz, C14-G, cat#154-G), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt Ser473 (Cell Signaling Technology), goat anti-Akt (Santa Cruz, C-20, cat#sc-1618), or an anti-alpha tubulin mAb (clone DM1A, NeoMarkers), followed by detection using appropriate anti-mouse, rabbit, or goat HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Labs) and ECL detection
2474852:The most highly characterized of these are the Raf proteins, PI3K, and the Ral guanidine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs), although Ras does recruit and activate other potentially transforming effectors [ 11 ]
2474852:HME16C cell lines infected with pLRT empty vector (pLRT), RasV12 (V12), or RasV12S35 (S35) were treated with 0.2% DMSO vehicle or 20 ?M PD98059 for 24 hours, followed by western blotting for TDAG51
2474852:Ras is a common signaling node for various cell surface receptors that contribute to epithelial cell transformation [ 14 ]
2474852:Twenty five micrograms of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and western blotted with anti-TDAG51 mAb (TDAG51)
2474852:Features were considered for analysis if the signal intensity was greater than one standard deviation above background with at least a 2:1 signal-to-background ratio
2474852:Therefore, TDAG51 loss, in the context of oncogene activation, may indirectly promote cell death as a consequence of enhanced cell cycling
2474852:Likewise, results with RasV12-infected cells stably infected with TDAG51-targeting shRNA also showed enhanced growth relative to vector-infected control cells, although to a lesser extent than that seen with RasV12S35-infected cells (Figure 6C )
2474852:These studies suggest that TDAG51 has a suppressive effect on tumor progression and prompted us to evaluate the cell biological function of TDAG51 in the HME16C transformation model
2474852:Retroviral vectors coding for amino terminal HA-tagged activated H-RasV12, the H-RasV12 effector domain mutants (EDM) H-RasV12G37, H-RasV12S35, and H-RasV12C40, and the constitutively activated version of a RalGEF, Rlf-CAAX, were used to infect telomerase immortalized HME16C human mammary epithelial cells
2474852:Data from GenePix Pro 4.0 was uploaded to the microarray database at the NCI/CCR Microarray Center website [ 25 ] for further analysis
2474852:This suggests that TDAG51 expression limits cellular proliferation
2474852:The blot was stripped and probed with an alpha tubulin monoclonal antibody (Alpha tubulin) to demonstrate equal protein loading
2474852:Anti-Ras and anti-HA western blotting demonstrated approximately equal levels of ectopic Ras expression among Ras-infected cells, with slightly lower levels in HME16C RasV12-infected cells relative to EDM-infected cells (Figure 1A )
2474852:These were similar to, but smaller than, the RasV12-infected cells
2474852:This, taken together with the finding that RasV12- and RasV12S35-transduced HME16C cells were able to form tumors in nude mice, indicates that the Raf-MEK-Erk axis plays a crucial role in mediating transformation and tumorigenesis in this model
2474852:Similar experiments to that shown were performed 2 additional times with similar results (B) Growth of pLVTHM vector control or TDAG51 shRNA-expressing RasV12S35-transduced cells either in the presence of 0.2% DMSO control (left) or 0.25 ?M PD153035 (right) in low-attachment plates, assessed by the alamar blue growth assay
2474852:Therefore, expression of Rlf-CAAX and subsequent RalA activation did not appear to be sufficient to induce anchorage-independent growth in the HME16C mammary epithelial cell line in contrast to HEK-HT and various other immortalized human cell types [ 27 ]
2474852:By contrast, under matrix detached conditions, the parental HME16C cells are non-proliferative, but do not actively undergo anoikis
2474852:However, the overall increased cell numbers in anchorage-independent conditions showed that enhanced cellular proliferation exceeded enhanced cell death
2680060:Peak differences in tumor rate between the transgenics and non-transgenic mice occurred during the age of 13�21 months (OR: 3.64 p<0.01)
2680060:In contrast, among the 15 transgenic tumors collected from the 13�24 month cohorts, 12 (80%) were found to have p16 promoter methylation (Fisher's exact test, p<0.1)
2680060:P16 promoter methylation (methylation specific PCR) was detected in 19 of 28 (68%) lung tumors ( Fig
2680060:Murine lung tumors have been shown to contain a high frequency of K-ras mutation in codon 61 [37] 
2680060:Thus the onset of K-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 in murine lung tumor appear to be an age related phenomenon, appearing at a similar rate in tumor-developing transgenic and non-transgenic littermates
2680060:In mice younger than 15 months no mutations at codons 12�13 of K-ras were found (0/10 tumors)
2680060:K-ras mutations were identified by utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to amplify the second and third exons (GenBank accession NC_00072, the start codon of K-ras is located in the second exon) followed by sequence analysis of the amplified product
2680060:Several potential mechanisms for p53 mutant induced tumorigenesis have been proposed
2680060:The overall comparison of tumor rates and mouse type were compared by Fisher's exact test
2680060:The latency period for tumors to develop in these transgenic mice would also suggest that mutant p53(273H) combine with other age-related genetic or epigenetic alterations, such as mutation at codon 12 or 13 of K-ras gene and inactivation of p16 by methylation of its promoter region, to promote lung tumor formation and progression in the p53(273H) transgenics
2680060:Mice were injected (intraperitoneally) with Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) 100 mg/kg in 0.9% NaCl
2680060:Among 21 transgenic tumors, ten tumor samples (47.6%) contained K-ras mutations
2680060:Previously we reported that the level of the mouse wild-type p53 protein was reduced in 10 of 10 tumor samples as compared to matched normal lung tissue of the transgenic mouse [57] 
2680060:P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Holm procedure [65] , [66] 
2680060:It is of particular interest to generate lung cancer models which reflect, as closely as possible, human lung cancer development
2680060:The long latency period for tumor development in the transgenic mice suggests collaboration with other oncogenic events for lung cancer development

2680060:However, DNA damage (e.g., radiation) induces a prominent increase in p53 protein levels [45] , [46] 
2680060:At the age extremes of 4�12 and 22�24 months no differences were observed, with very low prevalence of tumors in animals younger than 12 months, and a relatively high prevalence at age 22 months or older
2680060:Interestingly, the tumor rate differences observed between the transgenics and the non-transgenic counterparts beginning at 13 months equalizes after 22 months, suggesting that the genome instability associated with senescence [55] , [56] is diluting any difference that the transgene effect could produce
2680060:Light photomicrographs of lung tumor at 100� magnifications with HE staining (B)
2680060:All protocols on animal subjects were approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee
2680060:Immediately following tissue harvesting, lung tumors and normal lung tissues were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 12 h, rinsed with water, and preserved in 1� Phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS)
2680060:In addition, p53(273H) has also been reported to interact with and activate topoisomerase I to induce genomic instability [13] , [18] and to promote the reassociation of single-stranded RNA or DNA to a double-stranded form [19] 
2680060:Our results demonstrated that some tumor cells in the transgenic animals failed to initiate cell cycle arrest post irradiation, so that 0.93% lung tumor cells were Brdu positive

2680060:P16 gene promoter hypermethylation is a common event in lung cancers [36] ; up to 80% in lung adenocarcinomas [58] 
2680060:Either cell cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death to remove the damaged cell permanently follows [48] 
2680060:Funding: The work was supported by NCI grant CA76970 to M
2680060:Histopathologically, the tumors in both transgenic and non-transgenic groups were well differentiated adenocarcinoma with a predominantly bronchioloalveolar (BAC) pattern ( Figure 2 )
2680060:The same tumor was also stained with antibody against the Clara cell 10 protein (CC10), commonly used as a marker for Clara cell (B)
2680060:Non-irradiated controls were also injected with Brdu
2680060:One possibility is that mutant p53 inhibits the sequence-specific DNA-binding and transactivation functions of wild-type p53 in a �dominant-negative� manner by forming hetero-oligomeric complexes with it [10] , [11] 
2680060:The average percentage of BrdU positive cells was obtained from thirty random images (three mice per group)
2680060:The mice were injected with Brdu at dose of 100 mg/kg 22 hr post-irradiation
2680060:Mutations in the P53 gene are among the most common genetic abnormalities in human lung cancer
2680060:Paraffin embedded tissue was cut and incubated with monoclonal anti-Brdu antibody (DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) for Immunohistochemical analysis
2680060:The above results suggest that the lung tumors in the p53(273H) transgenic mice are composed of a mixed population of cells
2680060:The DNA was then precipitated with sodium acetate (final concentration, 0.45 M) and isopropanol
2680060:Wrote the paper: WD SHB GAO MAVC
2680060:The primers used for the MS-PCR were (U3?=? GTGATTGGGTGGGTATTGAATTTT TGTG , U4?=? CACACATCATACACACAA CCCTAAACCA ) for unmethylated, (M3?=? CGATTGGGCGGGTATTGAATTTTCGC , M4?=?

2680060:Restoration of p53 function leads to tumor regression in vivo [51] 
2680060:Age cohorts for K-ras mutation or p16 methylation were grouped and compared via Fisher's exact test due to the limited number of tumors
2680060:The primers were also used for sequencing analysis
2680060:Rates of lung cancer formation in the transgenic animals and their littermates were evaluated by necropsy studies performed in progressive age cohorts ranging from 4 to 24 months
2680060:The rate of tumors with codon 12�13 mutations was higher in the 16�18 month cohort compared to the younger age cohort in the transgenic mice (3/6 vs
2680060:Given that even one copy of intact p53 could cause a complete cell cycle arrest in mice lungs post irradiation, it follows that the Brdu positive cells observed in the lung tumors have lost p53 function completely
2680060:We analyzed 28 spontaneous lung tumors and found that 27% of lung tumors had K-ras mutations (all somatic) at codons 12�13 at the age of 13�24 months, whereas, no mutation was detected at these codons at an earlier age
2680060:Overall 13 of 21 (62%) transgenic lung tumors and 6 of 7 (86%) non-transgenic lung tumors contained p16 promoter methylation
2680060:Primers used to amplify exon 3 were 5?-GGCCAGGAGTGCATTAAGAC (forward), 5?- TGCAGGCATAACA ATTAGCAA (reverse)
2680060:These variant histological patterns are evidence of dedifferentiation, a phenomenon which human lung tumors readily exhibit
2680060:5E )
2680060:In normal cells, the steady state level of p53 protein is low and the half-life of p53 is very short due to the presence of negative regulators, such as Mdm2, JNK and Pirh2 [38] � [44] 
2680060:Well-differentiated BAC/adenocarcinoma from a transgenic (E) contrasts with a BAC/adenocarcinoma showing evidence of dedifferentiation into a solid undifferentiated carcinoma (F)
2680060:While p53 and K-ras codons 12/13 mutations and p16 promoter methylation status are well described in human lung cancers, the influence of age in the likelihood of these abnormalities to combine with early genetic events has not been previously explored
2680060:Our study supports the multi-step genetic hits process documented in other malignancies for which familial cancer clusters are available, and suggests the need to evaluate age related differences in the pattern of genetic and epigenetic aberrations linked to lung cancer in patient with this disease
2680060:The antibodies used were: anti-human p53 specific monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA); anti-?-Actin monoclonal (Sigma, St
2680060:To investigate the role of mutant p 5 3 in lung tumorigenesis, a lung specific p53(273H) transgenic mouse model was developed
2680060:DNA was eluted with dH2O and used for PCR
2680060:Among eight mutations in codon 61, six mutations were A to G transitions (CAA to CGA) and two were A to T transversions, CAA to CTA ( Fig
2680060:Lung tumors collected from the transgenic mice were all SP-C positive, suggesting that these lesions expressed alveolar type II pneumocyte differentiation ( Fig 3A, 3C )
2680060:Primers used to amplify exon 2 were 5?- AGGCCTGCTGAAAATGACTGA (forward), 5?- TTCTTGCACCTATGGTTCCCTA (reverse)
2680060:The bisulfite-treated DNA was purified with Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction
2680060:However, the transgenic mice had a significant higher lung tumor rate than their non-transgenic counterparts during the age of 13�21 months, suggesting an age-related shift in lung tumor formation induced by the lung-specific expression of the human mutant p53
2680060:The number of Brdu positive cell on a slide was counted directly under a compound microscope (400 magnification)

2680060:One microgram of genomic DNA was denatured by NaOH (final concentration, 0.275 M) for 10 min at 37�C
2680060:Among 28 lung tumors, eight tumors (29%) contained K-ras mutation in codon 61, and its frequency was similar between transgenics (27%) and non-transgenics (29%) and between the 4�12 months transgenic cohort (33%) and the 13�24 months transgenic cohort (27%), suggesting its lack of association with age or collaboration with P53 mutations (4�15 months vs
2680060:We thank the Transgenic Core Facility, Pathology Core Facility of The Ohio State University (OSU)
2680060:Altogether (including non-transgenics) the 16�18 month cohort had a higher rate of mutations at codons 12�13 of K-ras compared to the younger age cohort (5/9 vs
2680060:Overall lung tumor rate was 23.1% (65/281) and 11.6% (22/189) in the transgenic and non-transgenic mice, respectively (Fisher's exact test p?=?0.01)
2680060:Among four mutations in codon 12, three were G to A transitions, GGT to GAT; and one was G to T transversion, GGT to GTT ( Fig
2680060:17% respectively)
2680060:However, no significant differences in the rate of tumor development were observed at the extreme age ranges (4�12 and 22�24 months)
2680060:Some lung tumor cells retain murine wild type p53, while others lost the functional murine p53 and continue to proliferate even after irradiation

2680060:p53270H/+ mice (Murine p53 codon 270 correspond to human p53 codon 273) develop an increased incidence of carcinomas and B cell lymphomas compared to p53+/? mice [22] 
2680060:Older mice (>13 months) had a significantly higher rate of p16 promoter methylation (17% v 82%)
2680060:We previously reported the development of lung adenocarcinomas in SPCp53(273H) transgenic mice at a higher rate compared with their littermates at the age range of 13�15 months [23] 
2680060:The majority of the lung tumor cells were SP-C positive suggesting that these lesions arose from the alveolar type II cells (C)
2680060:The reduction in the level of murine wildtype p53 protein may be associated with overexpression of p53 ubiquitin�protein ligase Pirh2 and the �dominant-negative� effect of the mutant p53
2680060:All slides were quenched for 5 minutes in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase

2680060:Only one of six (17%) tumors tested at the age cohorts of 4�12 months contained p16 promoter methylation
2680060:Our study demonstrated aberrant methylation of the p16 gene more frequently in the 13�24 months cohort than in the 4�12 months cohort (82% vs
2680060:of thirty random images from three mice per treatment
2680060:Human cancers are similarly known to express evidence of type II pneumocyte and/or Clara cell differentiation
2680060:Mutations of p53, the vast majority within the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of the protein, produce mutant proteins unable to bind to and transactivate the target genes that mediate tumor suppression [48] � [50] 
2680060:One of the most important functions of wild type p53 is its anti-proliferation property
2680060:To study the role of p53 mutation in lung tumorigenesis, animal models in which the endogenous p53 gene is disrupted or mutated in a lung-specific manner, or in which mutant p53 transgenes are expressed in a lung-specific manner, would be of considerable value
2680060:Slides were then counterstained in hematoxylin, dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions and cover slipped
2680060:The increase in wild type p53 protein in response to DNA damage is believed to regulate p21 to prevent cells with genetic lesions to proliferate [47] 
2680060:All lung samples were carefully examined with the use of a dissecting microscope
2680060:Age differences in the type of K-ras mutations were observed, with a preference for codons 12�13 mutations to occur in the 13�24 month group ( Fig
2680060:Comparison of K-ras mutation in codons 12�13 and codon 61, (A) between 4�12 months and the 13�24 months transgenic lung tumors, and (B) between the transgenic tumors and the non-transgenic tumors in age of 13�24 months
2680060:At the age of 13�21 months, when additional genetic and epigenetic alterations are able to combine with the mutant p53, a significant difference in tumor formation between the transgenic and the non-transgenic mice would then be appreciated
2680060:Relevance to treatment efficacy with conventional chemotherapy or molecularly targeted treatment may be demonstrated by such studies
2680060:It has been reported that 50�60% of non-small cell lung cancers and 90% of small cell lung tumors contain p53 mutations; thus p53 alterations are among the most common genetic events in this malignancy [4] , [5] 
2680060:Performed the experiments: WD LG XW JXG HD
2680060:Thus p53(273H) could conceivably lead to increased cell proliferation, aberrant DNA recombination, increased genomic instability and reduced chemotherapy efficacy [20] , [21]

2680060:Point mutations in (C) K-ras codon 12, (D) K-ras codon 13, and (E) K-ras codon 61
2680060:These results would suggest that inactivation of p16 by methylation of its promoter region is, similar to K-ras codons 12�13 mutations, a late age dependent event contributing to lung tumor formation in the p53(273H) transgenic mice
2680060:The majority of p53 mutations are missense and found within the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain
2680060:and NCI grant P30 CA16058 to the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center
2680060:Slides were blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h before application of primary antibody
2680060:Multiple measurements for the % of cells BrdU positive were averaged for each mouse
2680060:Cell proliferation in lung tumors without irradiation (A), post irradiation (B), normal lung without irradiation (C) as well as normal lung tissue post irradiation (D), were analyzed
2680060:Lung tissue and lung tumors were harvested 2 hours after the injection, and then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 12 hours
2680060:A similar rate of K-ras mutations were observed between transgenic and non-transgenic animals ( Fig
2680060:The detection system used was a labeled Streptavidin-Biotin Complex
2680060:In the normal lung tissues, Brdu positive cell rate was 0.43% without irradiation, whereas there were almost no Brdu positive cells (0.009%) observed in the normal lung tissues post irradiation ( Fig
2680060:Adjusted p-values were considered significant at the 0.10 level given the exploratory nature of these studies and all tests were two sided
2680060:In addition, an age related effect was observed for K-Ras codons 12 or 13 mutations, but not for codon 61 mutations
2680060:Given the high prevalence of K-ras and p16 gene deficiencies in human lung cancers [33] � [36] , we evaluated for K-ras gene mutations and p16 promoter methylation in the spontaneous lung cancers in both transgenic and non-transgenic animals
2680060:Thus, compared to the non-irradiated tumors, the tumor cell proliferation rate was reduced 2.8 fold after ?-irradiation treatment ( Fig
2680060:A similar promoter methylation rate in the tumors of the transgenics and non-transgenic controls was found ( Table 1 )
2680060:5C )
2680060:In addition, 30% of lung samples with no visible surface tumors were subjected to random histological analysis
2680060:Mice were treated with ionizing radiation (5 Gy/mouse)

2680060:The averaged percentage of BrdU positive cell was obtained according to thirty random images taken from each treatment and tissue type group (E)
2680060:The general assumption is that tumor cells with intact p53 will stop proliferating after irradiation, whereas tumor cells with deficient p53 will proliferate continually post irradiation
2680060:Since human and murine p53 proteins are fully capable of forming hetero-oligomeric complexes [52] , it is therefore possible that human p53(273H) affected murine wild type p53 function in the transgenic mice studied through a �dominant-negative� effect leading to increased cell proliferation [53] , [54] 
2680060:Total body irradiation was performed using a 137Cesium ?-source at a dose of 5Gy/mouse
2680060:Alternatively, certain p53 mutants may possess intrinsic oncogenic potential, as their introduction into cells lacking endogenous p53 has been shown to enhance the tumorigenicity of these cells [12] , [50] 
2680060:To evaluate whether the murine wild type p53 is intact in the lung cancers collected from the SPC-p53 (273H) transgenic mice, we treated the transgenic mice using a 137Cesium ?-source at a dose of 5Gy/mouse
2680060:In comparison, there were no Brdu positive cells observed in the normal lung tissues collected from the same mouse post irradiation
2680060:To this end, we have developed a line of transgenic mice expressing the human p53(273H) gene under the transcriptional control of the human surfactant protein C (SP-C) promoter [23] 
2680060:Codon 273 in the sequence-specific DNA binding domain is one of the most frequently mutated sites
2680060:Unlike most tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins, p53(273H) retains partial sequence-specific DNA-binding and transcriptional activation functions [14] � [17] 
2680060:Our model may recapitulate what occurs in human cancer, where age specific differences have been reported [59] , [60] , and where tumor formation substantially lags behind the oncogenic stimulus [61] , [62] 
2680060:?-irradiation of tumors was performed to evaluate the functional activity of murine p53 in these spontaneous lung cancers
2680060:Using this model, differences between types of mice for each age cohort group were tested and odds ratios (OR) estimated through the interaction of mouse type and age cohort group
2680060:Other histological patterns evidencing dedifferentiation included secretory (G), oncocytic (H) and high nuclear grade (I) and were observed only in the transgenic tumors
2680060:One copy of the wild type p53 is sufficient to cause cell cycle arrest post irradiation [54] , which may explain the delay in tumor development in our transgenic animals with the two murine wildtype p53 alleles in addition to the human mutant
2680060:The most important function of wild type p53 is the sequence specific transactivation of target genes
2680060:DNA damage up-regulates wildtype p53 and leads to cell cycle arrest which provides sufficient time for repair [25] 
2680060:In summary, expression of mutant p53 (273H) in mice lungs resulted in an age-related demographic shift in lung tumor formation in the transgenic mice
2680060:Paraffin embedded tissue was cut at 4 microns, placed on slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE)
2680060:These results would suggest that the mutant p53(273H) contributes to an acceleration in the development of spontaneous lung tumors in these mice
2680060:Two mutations were found in codon 13; both were G to A transitions, GGC to GAC ( Fig
2680060:The denatured DNA was then treated with 10 �l of 10 mM hydroquinone, 520 �l of 3 M sodium bisulfite at 50�C overnight
2680060:Among 7 non-transgenic tumors, two mutations were found in exon 2 (codon 12) and two in codon 61 ( Table 1 )

2680060:Given the limited number of lung tumors in certain age cohorts, age cohorts were combined into three groups, 4�12, 13�21 and 22�24 months for comparisons between transgenic and non-transgenic mice
2680060:In contrast only 1 of 11 (9%) tumors examined in the non-transgenic group showed evidence of dedifferentiation (Fisher's exact test p?=?0.14)
2680060:The human mutant p53(273H), which has the most common substitution (arginine to histidine), has been shown to have both dominant-negative and gain-of-function properties [9] � [13]

2680060:5B )
2680060:Altogether, 18 of 22 (82%) tumors from 13�24 months (including non-transgenics) had p16 promoter methylation, which is statistically higher (Fisher's exact test, p<0.1) than for the 4�12 month group
2680060:22 hours post-irradiation, mice were injected (IP) with Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at a dose of 100 mg/kg in 0.9% NaCl
2680060:Six of the transgenic mice were 4�12 months, and fifteen 13�24 months
2680060:Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist
2680060:Ionizing irradiation induces elevation of wild type p53 protein and results in inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas knocking-out the p53 gene abolishes irradiation-induced cell cycle arrest
2680060:No difference was found in lung tumor rate between the transgenic mice and non-transgenic controls at the age range of 4�12 and 22�24 months
2680060:This type of Kras mutation is extremely rare in human tumors, especially lung cancer
2680060:Both irradiated and control mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were harvested 2 hours after the Brdu injection
2680060:This would also suggests that the p53(273H) has a weak dominant-negative effect
2680060:A lung tumor section was stained with antibody against surfactant protein C (SP-C), commonly used as a marker for the alveolar type II cell (A)
2680060:We analyzed 60 pathological images collected from six lung tumor bearing mice three of which had been irradiated
2680060:In all cases, each tumor contained a single site mutation at the second position of the codon
2680060:The arrows pointed the BrdU positive cells
2680060:However 13 of 24 (54%) tumors examined in transgenic mice exhibited areas of variant histology, including areas of clear secretory change, areas of high nuclear grade, areas of oncocytic change and areas of solid proliferation
2680060:Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies against the surfactant protein C (SP-C) and the Clara cell 10 protein (CC10), which are commonly used markers to distinguish alveolar type II cells from Clara cells
2680060:All non-transgenic tumors were collected at the age of 13�24 months, given their rare occurrence at an earlier age
2680060:The transgenic mice (T) have a statistically significant (Fisher's exact test p<0.01) higher lung tumor rate than wildtype controls (C) during the age of 13�21 months
2680060:Immunohistochemical detection of human mutant p53(273H) with human specific p53 antibody (DO-7) in a lung adenocarcinoma from an SPC-p53(273H) transgenic mouse (C)
2680060:All tumors observed were processed for histological analysis
2680060:Antigen retrieval was performed by placing the tissue sections in a citric acid solution (Dako's Target Retrieval Solution, pH 6.1) for 30 minutes at 94�C using a vegetable steamer
2680060:The SPC-p53(273H) transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of a 6.7-kb fragment of the SPC-p53(273H) construct into the pro-nuclei of FVB/N mouse zygotes as previously reported [23] 
2680060:All analyses were performed using STATA statistical software, version 10.0 [67] 
2680060:The bars show mean data �S.D
2680060:Previous in vitro studies support this notion [14] , [17] 
2680060:Histopathology suggested a more aggressive nature for the transgenic tumors
2680060:Given their association with P53 mutations in human lung cancer, we evaluated the rates of K-ras gene mutation and p16INK4a (p16) promoter methylation of the lung tumors
2680060:Combination with other genetic and epigenetic alterations occurring after the age of 13 months is intimately linked to its oncogenic potential
2680060:A small percentage of the lung tumor cells were CC-10 positive indicating of Clara cell lineage (D)
2680060:Human mutant p53(273H) mRNA and protein were demonstrated specifically in lung tissue [23] , [24] 
2680060:The rate of the BrdU positive cells was 2.61% in the non-irradiated tumors on average, whereas the proliferating rate was 0.93% in the irradiated lung tumor samples
2680060:It has been reported that K-ras mutations occur mainly in codons 12, 13 and 61 in murine lung tumors [37] , thus we investigated the DNA sequences of exons 2 and 3 that contain codons 12, 13 and 61 using PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing
2680060:P53 point mutation in one allele accompanied with complete loss of the second allele of p53 is a commonly reported phenomenon in human cancers [26] � [28] 
2680060:Additional sections for immunohistochemistry (IHC) were placed in a 60�C oven for 1 h, cooled, deparaffinized and rehydrated through xylene and graded ethanol solutions to water in standard fashion
2680060:Lung tumor and normal tissue were harvested 2 h after the injection, and then the tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 12 h
2680060:Seventy-five to eighty-five percent of lung cancers are categorized as non-small cell cancers (NSCLC); and adenocarcinoma has become the most prevalent NSCLC subtype [1] , [3] 
2680060:5A ) with a peak at 16�18 months (3/6 in transgenics and 5/9 in transgenic and non-transgenic tumors)
2680060:In order to establish the influence of other common genetic abnormalities in lung tumor formation in the animals, K-Ras gene mutation and p16INK4a (p16) promoter methylation were evaluated in a total of 281 transgenic mice and 189 non-transgenic littermates
2680060:At 24 h (hours) after irradiation, mice were sacrificed and lung tumors and normal lung tissues were harvested
2680060:The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.
2680060:However, a small percentage of the lung tumor cells also expressed CC-10 protein ( Fig

2680060:The number of BrdU positive cell on a slide was counted directly under a compound microscope
2680060:Slides were then placed on a Dako Autostainer immunostaining system for IHC
2680060:Lung tumor cells exhibit pleomorphic nuclei at 400� magnification (D)
2680060:We analyzed 28 murine lung tumors, 21 from the transgenic mice and 7 tumors from non-transgenic mice
2680060:Lung tumor rate and age of onset are summarized in Figure 1 
2680060:Codon 273 is one of the most frequently mutated sites [6] � [8] 
2680060:In order to investigate how the proportion of lung tumors vary between transgenic and non-transgenic mice over age cohorts logistic regression models were used [64] 
2680060:These included four in exon 2 (codons 12 or 13) and six in exon 3 (codon 61)
2680060:Bisulphite-treated tumor DNA was amplified with primers specific for either a methylated (M) or an unmethylated (U) p16INK4a promoter region (A)
2676548:To simulate clinical testing, the effects of NVP-BEZ235 were studied in five early passage primary pancreatic cancer xenografts, grown orthotopically
2676548:These tumours therefore offer the opportunity for the near-clinical testing of novel molecular targeted agents in a controlled laboratory setting that allows detailed analysis of the relationships between the tumour characteristics, pharmacological effects, and anticancer activity
2676548:Proteins in tissue homogenate were precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile and processed further for chromatographic separation as described below
2676548:Overall, the effects of NVP-BEZ235 appear less dramatic in these models relative to those seen in xenograft established from cell lines ( Maira et al , 2008 ; Serra et al , 2008 ), which are typically poorly differentiated and rapidly proliferating
2676548:The loading control was anti-actin (1?:?7000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)
2676548:Two groups of 10�12 randomly assigned tumour-bearing mice were treated with NVP-BEZ235 or the vehicle control given by oral gavage daily for 5 days per week
2676548:We observed decreases in the phosphorylation of downstream mTor targets, particularly the S6 ribosomal protein, that showed a similar time course to that seen with PKB/Akt phosphorylation
2676548:Because of the location of the tumour in the orthotopic pancreas site, the tumour size was not measured until the end of the experiments when the animals were killed 2?h after the final dose
2676548:Activation of intracellular signalling proteins was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the following phosphospecific antibodies: Ser473 PKB/Akt; rabbit monoclonal obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (CST, Danvers, MA, USA); phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (mouse monoclonal; CST)
2676548:Consequently, at the end of the 3- to 5-week treatment, orthotopic tumours were dissected free of surrounding normal tissues and weighed
2676548:Chronic dosing with 45?mg?kg?1 of NVP-BEZ235 was well tolerated, and produced significant tumour growth inhibition in three models
2676548:Horizontal lines indicate the mean value for each group
2676548:To investigate the mechanisms of tumour growth inhibition by NVP-BEZ235, the tumours were labelled for cleaved caspase 3 and the proliferation markers cyclin D1 and p27 by immunohistochemistry, and the staining intensities were measured using semi-automated image analysis protocols
2676548:Cut tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for morphological assessment, and by immunohistochemistry for relevant protein markers including surface receptor tyrosine kinases and SMAD4 using appropriate primary antibodies
2676548:These findings suggest that mTor inhibition occurs in vivo at drug concentrations comparable to those that inhibit PI3K
2676548:We also found a time-dependent suppression of the downstream mTor targets Ser235/236 S6 ribosomal protein and Thr37/46 4E-BP1 in all five models, consistent with the action of NVP-BEZ235 as a dual PI3K and mTor inhibitor
2676548:To each gram of tissue 1?ml of phosphate-buffered saline was added
2676548:In a pilot study we found that at a daily dose of 45?mg?kg?1 NVP-BEZ235 was well tolerated by the SCID mice used for the xenografts, although weight loss occurred with more intensive treatment
2676548:Apart from promoting cell growth, several signalling pathways diverge downstream from activated PKB/Akt that suppresses apoptosis
2676548:Stock solutions of the analyte BEZ235 (MW 469.6) and the structurally related internal standard (IS, MW 476.6) were prepared fresh daily at a concentration of 10? ? g?ml?1 (analyte) and 1? ? g?ml?1 (IS) in methanol/water (2?:?9, v/v)
2676548:It remains to be determined if the daily oral dosing schedule for NVP-BEZ235 used in this study will be optimal in the clinic
2676548:However, it is possible that higher doses given intermittently might give a better therapeutic ratio by producing more complete PI3K inhibition in the tumour, while allowing time for normal tissue recovery
2676548:There was a trend towards reduced labelling for cyclin D1 in the NVP-BEZ235-treated groups ( Figure 8 ), and this was statistically significant in OCIP17, 19, and 21, whereas in the non-responsive OCIP18 model there was a non-significant increase in cyclin D1 in the NVP-BEZ235-treated animals
2676548:Tumour homogenate (25? ? l) was mixed with appropriate amounts of BEZ235 to deliver a nominal final concentration of 10�2000?ng?ml?1
2676548:Following overnight incubation with the primary antibody, the blots were probed with either anti-rabbit polyclonal or anti-mouse monoclonal secondary antibodies labelled with horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare Biosciences Inc
2676548:The pharmacodynamic effects of acute single doses were investigated by western blot and ELISA analyses of the tumour lysates
2676548:Cellular DNA content analysis by flow cytometry confirmed that in many of these tumours normal mouse cells accounted for >80% of the total cell population
2676548:The acute single dose of 50?mg?kg?1 NVP-BEZ235 administered by oral gavage was well tolerated
2676548:The calibration curve was prepared by adding the structurally related IS and appropriate amounts of analyte to mouse plasma or tumour tissue extract, covering a range from 2 to 2000?ng?ml?1 with LOQ set to 10?ng?ml?1 for plasma and 50?ng?g?1 for the tumour tissue respectively (CV and overall bias less than 30%)
2676548:Furthermore, phosphorylated PKB/Akt was detectable in the tumour samples obtained 2?h after the final dose in the chronic treatment group, indicating incomplete drug target inhibition
2676548:However, in the longer term it is likely that synergistic interactions could be obtained combining PI3K inhibitors with agents targeting other signalling pathways that are aberrantly regulated in pancreatic cancers
2676548:Compound concentrations in the tumour tissue 2?h after last treatment were in average of 1.11, 1.30, 0.81, and 1.16?nmol?g?1, for OCIP16, 18, 17, and 21 respectively
2676548:It is unlikely that complete target inhibition could be sustained over long periods in animal models or cancer patients, because PI3K signalling is critical in the maintenance of normal tissues
2676548:The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway is frequently deregulated in pancreatic cancers, and is believed to be an important determinant of their biological aggression and drug resistance
2676548:Five primary pancreatic cancer xenografts, designated OCIP16, 17, 18, 19, and 21, were used at passage number 4�6 for these experiments
2676548:Loss of weight occurred in the control groups of OCIP16 and 17, which was presumably the effect of the tumours, but the other groups of animals maintained their weight during the course of treatment and there were no statistically significant differences in the body weights of treated and control animals at the end of treatment in any of the five groups ( Figure 5 )
2676548:Scale bar in the top left panel=500? ? m
2676548:Animal experiments were carried out using protocols approved by University Health Network Animal Welfare Committee
2676548:Plots show the per cent labelled areas for individual tumours and the mean values, together with P -values based on unpaired two-tailed Student's t -tests.
2676548:The criterion for statistical significance was P <0.05
2676548:Histological sections of the orthotopically grown primary pancreatic cancer xenografts stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E; right panels), and by immunohistochemistry using anti-Ser473 Akt (left panels)
2676548:Once sufficient tumour tissue was available, typically at passage number two or three, orthotopic tumours were rapidly excised and divided into roughly similar pieces
2676548:The characteristics of the primary xenografts are summarised in Table 1 
2676548:The activation of downstream survival signalling pathways likely has an important role in the aggressive clinical features of pancreatic cancer, including resistance to chemotherapy
2676548:In the present paper we tested the effects of NVP-BEZ235 in a series of five early passage primary pancreatic cancer xenografts, and show that acute oral single doses suppress signalling targets downstream from PI3K/mTor in a time-dependent manner consistent with the pharmacokinetics of the compound, and that chronic treatment produces significant growth inhibition
2676548:Grant support : National Cancer Institute of Canada/Canadian Cancer Society
2676548:Phosphorylated Stat3 was readily detected in all five models, consistent with previous reports showing aberrant activation in pancreatic cancer cells ( DeArmond et al , 2003 ), but there was no significant decrease in the levels following treatment with NVP-BEZ235 ( Figure 4 ), suggesting that the mechanisms of Stat3 activation are largely independent of PI3K signalling
2676548:Staining for Ser473 Akt was also observed in the stroma of some of the xenografts, but this was less intense that seen in the tumour tissue
2676548:As shown in Figure 6 , NVP-BEZ235 treatment of tumour models OCIP16, 17, and 21 resulted in statistically significant delay in tumour growth (56, 36, and 46% respectively) when compared with vehicle-treated controls
2676548:Because the acute effects on PKB/Akt phosphorylation were comparable to those seen with the other primary xenografts, the lack of response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment is likely explained by the activity of additional oncogenic signalling pathways in OCIP18, rather than failure to inhibit the drug target
2676548:Cyclin D1 levels in tumour tissue following chronic dosing with NVP-BEZ235 or drug vehicle, measured using immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative image analysis
2676548:In all models tested, acute single doses of NVP-BEZ235 decreased the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, as well as its immediate downstream target GSK3, with maximum inhibition at the 2?h time point followed by recovery at 24?h, consistent with the pharmacokinetics of this compound ( Maira et al , 2008 )
2676548:For example, we have previously shown that this can markedly enhance sensitivity to the standard agent gemcitabine when used in an intermittent dose schedule ( Ng et al , 2001 )
2676548:In three of the five primary xenografts, we observed statistically significant reduction in the tumour size or weight relative to the drug vehicle control group, which was consistent with the impression obtained from abdominal palpation that oral daily treatment with NVP-BEZ235 inhibited tumour growth
2676548:Examination of newly formed blood vessels using CD31 staining showed that these were substantially present in the surrounding fibrovascular stroma, rather than invading into tumour masses
2676548:Animal weights during chronic administration of NVP-BEZ235 or vehicle control
2676548:Interestingly, Schnell et al (2008) have recently shown that NVP-BEZ235 inhibited microvessel permeability in a syngeneic rat mammary carcinoma model, but we did not test for this effect in the present study
2676548:At the end of treatment the animals were killed and the tumours were harvested and weighed after removal of non-tumoural tissues
2676548:Western blots of tumour lysates obtained 2?h after the final dose of NVP-BEZ235 in the chronic dosing groups of animals, probed for Ser473 Akt and Ser235/236 and Ser240/244 S6 ribosomal protein, with actin loading controls
2676548:There was also inhibition of Ser235/236 S6 ribosomal protein and Thr37/46 4E-BP1, consistent with the effects of NVP-BEZ235 as a dual PI3K/mTor inhibitor
2676548:Sample injection volume was 5? ? l for the chromatographic separation
2676548:Codon 12/13 K-ras mutations were determined by gene sequencing
2676548:No significant effects on p27 were seen in any of the five primary xenograft models
2676548:NVP-BEZ235 is a novel imidazoquinoline derivative that shows high selectivity for class I PI3K and the structurally related mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor; Maira et al , 2008 )
2676548:Similar to the ELISA data shown in Figure 3 , we observed considerable inter-tumoural heterogeneity within the triplicate samples, which to some extent tracked differences in the total protein levels, as shown in Supplementary Figure 1 
2676548:The levels of Ser473 phosphorylated PKB/Akt measured by ELISA showed considerable inter-tumoural heterogeneity, which reflects the complex nature of these tumours relative to subcutaneous implants of cell lines, but there was an obvious decrease in the mean values in all five models at 2?h, followed by recovery over 24?h ( Figure 3 )
2676548:Homogenates were clarified by centrifuging at 14?000?r.p.m
2676548:These data show that different maximum concentrations are achieved in the four models but that in all cases, the compound is cleared form the tumour tissue with time, in agreement with the reported mouse pharmacokinetic profile ( Maira et al , 2008 )
2676548:The importance of aberrant PI3K signalling in cancer has been recognised for many years ( Hennessy et al , 2005 ; Woodgett, 2005 ; Vogt et al , 2006 ; Workman et al , 2006 )
2676548:Hence we believe that the long-term strategy needed for an intractable problem such as pancreatic cancer requires closer integration between basic science and clinical oncology, including the preclinical testing based on models similar to those used in the present study
2676548:Again, we feel that this might reflect differences in the growth patterns seen using the orthotopic primary xenografts
2676548:Concentrations of unknown samples were calculated from the peak area ratio of the daughter ion of the analyte to the daughter ion of its IS (ordinate) against the nominal concentration (abscissa)
2676548:Drug concentrations were found to be in average higher at 2?h than 24?h after administration (1.01 vs 0, 28.4 vs 0.50, 5.5 vs 1.44, 2.1 vs 1.20?nmol?g?1, for OCIP16, 18, 17, and 21 respectively; Figure 4 )
2676548:The liquid chromatographic separations were carried out using an Agilent 1100 Series (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) HPLC system with vacuum degasser, capillary pump, and thermostated column compartment (40�C) combined with an automated injection device (CTC-PAL; CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland)
2676548:In contrast, the novel agent NVP-BEZ235 has suitable drug-like properties, and is currently been tested in phase I clinical trials in cancer patients
2676548:An alternative strategy would be to combine a PI3K inhibitor like NVP-BEZ235 with other anticancer agents
2676548:Tumour weights at the completion of chronic dose administration
2676548:Histological examination of the H&E sections showed that the primary xenografts were adenocarcinomas with features similar to the original surgical specimens, with the exception of OIP17 that grew as sheets of poorly differentiated cancer cells
2676548:As seen in Figure 2 , the histological features were more complex than those typically seen in xenografts established at the subcutaneous site from cell lines, as has been previously noted ( Rubio-Viqueira et al , 2006 )
2676548:NVP-BEZ235 did not show accumulation over time in all the four tumour models tested, arguing that the efficacy is likely due to similar effects observed after a single-dose administration
2676548:This is supported by recent results from a randomised clinical trial that showed a modest but significant improvement in patient survival when the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib was combined with the standard chemotherapy agent gemcitabine ( Moore et al , 2007 )
2676548:By western blot, phosphorylated Akt and S6 were readily detected in these tumours excised 2?h after the final dose of NVP-BEZ235 ( Figure 7 ), although it should be noted that the sample processing was considerably longer than that for the acute time course experiment shown in Figure 4 , which might have affected these results
2676548:Furthermore, continuous oral dosing schedules with NVP-BEZ235 are growth inhibitory in human tumour xenograft mice and rat models ( Maira et al , 2008 )
2676548:All values are presented as mean�s.e
2676548:One of these was processed for protein extraction, one was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and one was fixed in formaldehyde followed by paraffin embedding
2676548:Primary xenografts established from this material were subsequently transferred to the orthotopic site of 4- to 5-week-old mice by attaching tumour pieces from the previous passage to the surface of the exposed pancreas, by a small incision under general anaesthesia
2676548:Primary xenografts can be established in immune-deprived mice from the majority of pancreatic cancer resections
2676548:By immunohistochemistry, phosphorylated Akt was readily detected in all five models ( Figure 2 )
2676548:Non-significant growth inhibition was also seen in a fourth primary xenograft, OCIP19
2676548:The slides were then scanned using a ScanScope CS (Aperio Technologies Inc., Vista, CA, USA)
2676548:NVP-BEZ235 is a novel, dual class I PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) inhibitor undergoing phase I human clinical trials
2676548:Gradient mobile programming was used with a flow rate 60? ? l?min?1; the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 0.2% formic acid in water (95?:?5)
2676548:The clinical development of treatment protocols incorporating multiple molecular targeted agents is problematic, because the optimum combination would depend on the specific pattern abnormalities in a particular cancer patient
2676548:Western blots of tumour lysates obtained from triplicate primary xenografts at the indicated time points following an acute single dose of NVP-BEZ235, 50?mg?kg?1, probed with primary antibodies to: Ser473 Akt, Ser21/9 GSK3 ? / ? , Ser235/236 S6 ribosomal protein, Thr37/46 4EBP-1, Tyr705 Stat3, with actin loading controls
2676548:The tumour-bearing mice were also monitored by abdominal palpation, which gave a rough indication of tumour growth
2676548:Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on British Journal of Cancer website ( http://www.nature.com/bjc ) Structure of NVP-BEZ235
2676548:To assess the effects of chronic drug administration on angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis, paraffin-embedded sections of tumour tissues were stained by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to CD31, cyclin D1, p27, and cleaved caspase 3
2676548:Calibration samples were prepared in pooled homogenates of the corresponding tumours obtained from untreated animals
2676548:NVP-BEZ235 ( Figure 1 ) was obtained from the Oncology Department of the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland
2676548:Minced tumour pieces were homogenised in 1?ml lysis buffer (50?mmol?l?1 HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 150?mmol?l?1 NaCl, 1?mmol?l?1 EDTA, 1.5?mmol?l?1 MgCl2, 100?mmol?l?1 NaF, 10?mmol?l?1 NaP2O7�H2O, 1?mmol?l?1 NaVO4) containing protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for 1?h on ice
2676548:Acute oral dosing with NVP-BEZ235 strongly suppressed the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, followed by recovery over 24?h
2676548:Experimental PI3K inhibitors can sensitise resistant cancer cells to cytotoxic agents or radiation, suggesting therapeutic potential in the clinic, but until recently in vivo testing was limited due to their toxicity or poor pharmacological properties
2676548:Signal transduction and activator of transcription (Stat) 3, Tyr705 (mouse monoclonal; CST) and Ser727 (rabbit polyclonal; CST)
2676548:A 50? ? l aliquot (1? ? g?ml?1) of the IS was added to each calibration standard and to the QC samples and mixed on a vortex mixer for 15?s
2676548:The enhancement of cell survival by PI3K signalling probably has a major function during early cancer development, and has also been linked to the high levels drug and radiation resistance seen in patients with pancreatic cancer ( Ng et al , 2001 ; Bondar et al , 2002 ; Mackenzie, 2004 ; Brunner et al , 2005 ), although it should be noted that pancreatic cancers are heterogeneous, and the activation of additional signalling elements, including Stat3, NF?B, and hedgehog pathway, is also likely to be an important determinant of biological aggression ( Bardeesy and DePinho, 2002 ; Arlt et al , 2003 ; DeArmond et al , 2003 ; Thayer et al , 2003 )
2676548:These findings confirm that NVP-BEZ235 is able to inhibit the activation of downstream PI3K effectors in vivo 
2676548:Digital image analysis was carried out using the Aperio software, based on 10 fields of view of the tumoural area for each section, at � 10 magnification
2676548:Further dilutions were prepared in the same solvent
2676548:In agreement with the experience from other groups, we have previously shown that primary xenografts can be established from the majority of pancreatectomy specimens and that when grown at the orthotopic site, they show typical histological features of pancreatic cancer ( Ng et al , 2002 ; Rubio-Viqueira et al , 2006 )
2676548:This produced small, slow-growing tumours, and a statistically significant effect might have been lost due to measurement error
2676548:Daily oral administration of NVP-BEZ235 at a dose of 45?mg?kg?1 was well tolerated in the tumour-bearing mice
2676548:In addition to its activity against class I PI3K, and like other PI3K inhibitors, such as wortmannin and LY294002 ( Brunn et al , 1996 ), NVP-BEZ235 also blocks the catalytic activity of mTor
2676548:Using the 45?mg?kg?1 daily for 5 days per week dose schedule, we did not see increased toxicity relative to the drug vehicle control group during the treatment period
2676548:Owing to their small size, insufficient material was available for the OCIP19 tumours
2676548:Treatment commenced when the tumours were just palpable, and the duration was 3�5 weeks according the rates of tumour growth for the different models
2676548:It has pharmacological properties that allow it to be tested for anticancer effects in vivo , and is well tolerated at dose schedules that result in decrease phosphorylated levels of the downstream target PKB/Akt
2676548:Comparisons between two groups (control vs NVP-BEZ235) were achieved using the two-tailed Student's t -test
2676548:However, the acute single-dose experiments showed that the NVP-BEZ235 dose used did not completely inhibit PKB/Akt in tumour tissue, and the effect was of relatively short duration
2676548:To monitor the acute pharmacodynamic effects of NVP-BEZ235, five groups each of three randomly assigned tumour-bearing mice were treated with 50?mg?kg?1 NVP-BEZ235 by oral gavage and killed at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24?h
2676548:The column eluent was directly introduced into the ion source of the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer Quattro Micro (Micromass, Manchester, UK) controlled by MassLynx 4.0 software
2676548:Membrane blots were blocked for 1?h at room temperature with 10% BSA in TBS with 1% Tween 20 and then incubated overnight at 4�C with the following primary phosphospecific antibodies: Ser473 PKB/Akt (rabbit monoclonal from CST, 1?:?500 dilution), Ser21/9 GSK3 ? / ? (rabbit polyclonal from CST, 1?:?1000), Ser235/236 S6 ribosomal protein (CST; 1?:?7000) and Ser240/244 S6 ribosomal protein (rabbit polyclonal (CST; 1?:?1000), Thr37/46 4E-BP-1 (CST; 1?:?1000), Ser727 Stat3 (CST; 1?:?1000), and Tyr705 Stat3 (CST; 1?:?1000)
2676548:These tumours showed activated PKB/Akt, and increased levels of at least one of the receptor tyrosine kinases that are commonly activated in pancreatic cancers
2676548:To assess the anticancer effects, the NVP-BEZ235 dose was reduced to 45?mg?kg?1, q.d., which is a dose and schedule that have been shown to be efficacious in in vivo mouse xenograft human cancer models ( Maira et al , 2008 )
2676548:Tumour NVP-BEZ235 concentrations for each sample are indicated, with the exception of those of insufficient size for this (ND)
2676548:After three times repeated protein precipitation by addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile followed by evaporation to dryness, the samples were re-dissolved in 100? ? l acetonitrile/water (1?:?9, v/v) containing 0.2% v/v formic acid
2676548:A fourth model, OCIP19, also showed growth inhibition, but this effect did not reach statistical significance, whereas there was no significant growth inhibition in OCIP18
2676548:The tumours were then processed for further analysis, similar to the acute single-dose series
2676548:The mice were monitored three times weekly by body weight and abdominal palpation, and for signs of distress, and killed according to animal welfare guidelines if they showed >10% loss of body weight or other signs of significant distress due to tumour growth or treatment toxicity
2676548:These tumours therefore appear to provide a realistic laboratory setting in which to test novel agents for treating a clinically intractable problem
2676548:We also failed to show significant anti-angiogenic effects in the orthotopic primary pancreatic cancer xenografts, which is in contrast with other groups who have reported pronounced anti-angiogenic effects by mTor inhibitors used to treat xenografts established from pancreatic cancer cell lines ( Azzariti et al , 2008 ; Manegold et al , 2008 )
2676548:Pharmacodynamic effects were measured following acute single doses, and anticancer effects were determined in separate groups following chronic drug exposure
2676548:After ESI(+) ionisation, the molecular�product transitions ( m/z 470.35 ? 443.25 product ion for BEZ235 and m/z 477.45 ? 477.30 product ion for the IS) were monitored for the analyte and IS respectively
2676548:Given the high prevalence of genetic changes that can drive PI3K signalling in pancreatic cancers, we examined the pharmacodynamic and anticancer effects of NVP-BEZ235 in a series of five recently established primary pancreatic cancer xenografts
2676548:Effects of acute single doses of NVP-BEZ235 on phosphorylated Akt measured using an ELISA technique (10? ? g total protein per 50? ? l well)
2676548:Groups of animals bearing the five primary xenografts at the orthotopic site were treated with 50?mg?kg?1 NVP-BEZ235 and killed at the indicated time points
2676548:Aberrant signalling by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a prominent feature of pancreatic cancers, due to the high prevalence of abnormalities that regulate this pathway, including K-ras mutations that occur in approximately 90% of cases, increased expression of receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR, and loss of PTEN ( Korc, 1998 ; Ruggeri et al , 1998 ; Bardeesy and DePinho, 2002 ; Agbunag and Bar-Sagi, 2004 ; Asano et al , 2004 ; Chadha et al , 2006 )
2676548:The tumours were rapidly excised and divided into pieces that were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, or fixed in formaldehyde and then were paraffin-embedded, or processed for protein extraction
2676548:We tested for anticancer effects of NVP-BEZ235 using daily oral dosing, which is similar to treatment schedules commonly used in clinical trials testing novel molecular targeted agents
2676548:Fresh pancreatic cancer samples that were superfluous to diagnostic needs were obtained from the University Health Network Tumour Tissue Bank according to institutional human ethical guidelines
2676548:We also observed a decrease in Ser9/21GSK3 ? / ? levels by western blot that followed a similar time course to p-Akt ( Figure 4 ), consistent with inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by NVP-BEZ235 in these models
2676548:Tumour fragments were initially implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of male SCID mice
2676548:Electrospray positive ionisation (ESI(+)) multiple reaction monitoring was used for the MS/MS detection of BEZ235
2676548:However, none of these yielded significant changes in patterns of blood vessel formation in any of the drug-treated tumours, relative to the vehicle controls
2676548:It is likely that the use of orthotopically grown early passage primary xenografts provides a better prediction of clinical activity, relative to in vivo sensitivity testing based on pancreatic cancer cell lines
2676548:The quality control (QC) samples were spiked with the analytes to give a final concentration of nominally 40, 100, 400, and 1600?ng?ml?1 respectively
2676548:Hence the lack of efficacy observed in the model OCIP18 cannot be accounted for by a lack of exposure
2676548:Joao Magalhaes was responsible for the pathological examination of the primary xenografts, and we thank him, and James Ho May Cheung, and Trudey Nicklee for their excellent technical help with the immunohistochemistry staining and digital image analysis
2676548:The kinase domain of this serine/threonine kinase has a high sequence similarity to PI3K
2676548:Particularly when grown at the orthotopic site, they show growth patterns including the formation of glandular structures embedded in a dense fibrovascular stroma that strikingly resemble those seen in surgical samples ( Capella et al , 1999 ; Ng et al , 2002 ; Rubio-Viqueira et al , 2006 )
2676548:Results from in vitro experiments suggest that the anticancer effects of PI3K inhibitors are dependant on the extent and duration of target inhibition
2676548:Cleaved caspase 3 showed low levels of staining relative to that previously observed by us in xenografts established from cell lines, and there was no significant increase in staining in any of the primary xenograft groups treated with NVP-BEZ235
2676548:This finding is consistent with previously reported in vivo efficacy studies from the Novartis group ( Stauffer et al , 2007 ; Maira et al , 2008 )
2676548:Quantitative analysis of tumour samples for BEZ235 was performed with an HPLC/dual mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method
2676548:Samples were then heated in sample buffer for 10?min at 95�C, run on 10% SDS�polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes using the Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoresis Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada)
2676548:The tumours tended to be moderately well differentiated, with mucin production
2676548:We tested several image analysis routines based on the number of CD31-stained blood vessels, their size, and distribution within tumour tissue and stroma
2676548:Fresh stock solutions of the compound were prepared daily by dissolving in 1 volume of NMP (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) in a 100�C water bath, then adding 9 volumes of PEG300 (Sigma-Aldrich) to give a final drug concentration of 12.5?mg?ml?1
2676548:Perhaps relevant to this, the levels of cyclin D1, which can be regulated by several mechanisms downstream of PI3K/mTor, showed a decrease in all models with the exception of OCIP18 ( Figure 8 )
2676548:Tumour morphology was assessed by a pathologist, and the intensity of immunohistochemical staining for each of the tumour markers was scored from 0 (absent staining) to 3+ (strong staining)
2676548:The establishment of the primary pancreatic cancer xenografts was carried out as previously described ( Ng et al , 2002 ; Yau et al , 2005 )
2676548:Regression analysis was performed using QuanLynx 4.0 (Micromass) and Excel 2002 (Microsoft)
2676548:Assay linearity was indicated by an overall regression coefficient of 0.9981
2676548:Immunohistochemical staining for the various growth factor receptors showed prominent surface membrane staining for EGFR in most cases, and variable expression of HER2 (ErbB2), c-Met (HGFR), and IGF-1R, often with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity in staining intensity
2676548:Tumour concentrations of NVP-BEZ235 were measured in all of the acute single-dose samples with the exception of OCIP19, where insufficient material was available due to their small size
2676548:We thank Dr Steven Gallinger and Dr Ming Tsao for their help establishing the primary pancreatic cancer xenografts, and past and present members of the Hedley Lab, particularly Drs Nhu-An Pham and Diana Birle for their helpful comments
2676548:The tissues were homogenised using an ULTRA-TURRAX (TP18-10; IKA, Staufen, Germany) homogeniser, keeping the material during the homogenisation as cold as possible by returning the homogenate to an ice bath between short (approximately 15?s) bursts
2676548:As chromatographic separation matrix a RESECT Ultra Cyano reverse-phase HPLC column (column size 50 � 1?mm, particle size 3? ? m, preceded by a guard column: Phenomenex AJO-4304 phenylpropyl, size 4 � 2?mm) was used
2676548:They were organised into glandular structures, with a prominent fibrovascular stroma that in some cases comprised the bulk of the tumour
2676548:These results predict that agents targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway might have anticancer activity in pancreatic cancer patients, and support the testing of combination studies involving chemotherapy or other molecular targeted agents
2676548:Furthermore, we have previously shown that treatment with the natural product wortmannin resulted in decreased PKB/Akt phosphorylation in an orthotopic xenograft model of pancreas cancer, consistent with PI3K inhibition, and that combined treatment with wortmannin and gemcitabine resulted in greater acute induction of apoptosis, and improved tumour growth inhibition, compared to gemcitabine alone ( Ng et al , 2001 )
2676548:Nevertheless, the response rate of 3/5 seen in the present study appears greater than that recently reported for other molecular targeted agents in primary pancreatic cancer xenografts ( Rubio-Viqueira et al , 2006 ), suggesting that dual PI3K/mTor inhibitors like NVP-BEZ235 might have useful anticancer effects in pancreatic cancer patients
2676548:Baie d'Urfe, Quebec, Canada) and then exposed to SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions
2676548:The primary end points for this part of the study were animal body and the tumour weight at the end of the treatment period
2676548:A fifth model, OCIP18, was insensitive to growth inhibition by NVP-BEZ235
2676548:at 4�C for 15?min
2360724:For amplification, a DNA thermocycler (MBS 0.2S, Hybaid, Ashford, UK) was used
2360724:Notably, Toyota et al (2000) found K-Ras mutations significantly prevalent in CRCs with the so called methylator phenotype (CIMP) compared with CIMP negative cases
2360724:Out of 202 cases, p16INK4A promoter methylation was found in 67 (33%) cases
2360724:No other association was found between RASSF1A methylation and the clinico-pathological parameters under study
2360724:Lee et al (2004) examined promoter methylation of 12 different genes in 149 CRCs and found that 9% were unmethylated
2360724:Out of 202 CRCs, thirty-four (17%) were free from molecular abnormalities and with no association with M+ vs M? tumours
2360724:Coincidental methylation of these genes was also documented in 12 cases, 11 of whose were M+ CRCs ( P =0.042)
2360724:Conversely, the frequency of CRCs in the group showing three or more alterations was higher in M+ than in M? tumours (34/130=26% vs 9/72=12%; P =0.023)
2360724:B-Raf V599E mutations were analysed first by amplification using primers forward (0.2?pmol? ? l?1; Proligo, Boulder, CO, USA): 5?-CTGTTTTCCTTTACTTACTACACCTCAGATA-3? and reverse (0.2?pmol? ? l?1; Proligo, Boulder, CO, USA): 5?-CTCAATTCTTACCATCCACAAAATG-3?
2360724:Hypermethylation of selected CpG sites within CpG islands in the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes is associated with loss of gene expression and is observed in both physiological conditions and neoplasia ( Kim et al , 2005b )
2360724:Primary but yet metastatic CRCs were prevalent in the latter group ( P =0.023) where the most frequent combination was one genetic (K-Ras in particular) and two epigenetic alterations
2360724:Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between K-Ras mutations and M+ tumours (OR 2.37, 95% CI, 1.15�4.88, P =0.019)
2360724:The present study was aimed to investigate both genetic and epigenetic changes occurring in CRC by comparing the molecular profiles of primary metastatic and nonmetastatic tumours
2360724:A sample was classified as methylated whenever a band, corresponding to the molecular weight of the methylated PCR product, had a thickness and staining intensity equal or greater than that of the unmethylated PCR product
2360724:Indeed, the 5-year-survival is over 90% for Duke's stage A, but only 5% for Duke's stage D ( de la Chapelle, 2004 )
2360724:All these variables retained a statistical significance in multivariate analysis (right side: OR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.40�0.87, P =0.007; older age: OR 1.039, 95% CI, 1.01�1.07, P =0.004; RASSF1A methylation: OR 2.11, 95% CI, 1.01�4.41, P =0.047)
2360724:This paper was supported by MURST (COFIN 2003)
2360724:Aim of this study was to characterise genetic and epigenetic molecular alterations occurring in primary advanced M+ and M? CRCs
2360724:We designed a study aimed to compare genetic and epigenetic changes occurring in primary advanced nonmetastatic CRCs as opposed to primary advanced metastatic CRCs
2360724:The prognosis is significantly affected by the tumour stage that mainly rests on the ability to metastasise to lymph nodes and/or to the liver
2360724:In our study, p53 abnormalities were not prevalent in M+ tumours suggesting a limited role of p53 in CRC metastatisation
2360724:Modification was completed by NaOH treatment (final concentration 0.3? M ) for 5?min at room temperature, followed by ethanol precipitation
2360724:Codon 12 K-Ras mutations were found in 54 cases (27%)
2360724:Abnormalities of K-Ras are key events in colorectal carcinogenesis and mutations of the gene arise early during the colonic transformation in 20�50% of the tumours ( Bazan et al , 2002 )
2360724:Multivariate analysis showed that gene methylation was statistically associated with M+ tumours (OR 3.48, 95% CI, 1.66�7.26, P =0.001) and with RASSF1A methylation (OR 2.29, 95% CI, 1.07�4.89, P =0.032)
2360724:Reduced expression of E-Cadherin owing to aberrant CpG island hypermethylation has been regarded as one of the main molecular events involved in the dysfunction of the cell�cell adhesion system ( Darwanto et al , 2003 ), in invasion and metastasis ( Garinis et al , 2002 )
2360724:The group of M+ tumours showing three or more abnormal genes was characterised by a single genetic mutation (usually K-Ras ; 53%) and by two epigenetic alterations (equally affecting p16INK4A , RASSF1A and E-Cadherin )
2360724:It is unclear why advanced and M+ CRCs showed a high degree of methylation: perhaps advanced tumours inherited a major biological aggressiveness or were simply more likely to become methylated
2360724:After 40 cycles of amplification (annealing temperature 55�C), amplified DNA was subjected to Tsp RI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) restriction digestion because this mutation abrogates a restriction site present in the wild-type sequence
2360724:This hypothesis is in keeping with a stepwise model of progression of CRC
2360724:Mutations most commonly occur in the highly conserved region (exons 5�8), which encodes the DNA-binding domain ( Zhang et al , 1997 )
2360724:The RASSF1A locus at 3p21.3 is methylated at high frequency in a variety of solid tumours including CRC, where this gene has been analysed as an alternative marker to downregulate Ras pathway ( Pizzi et al , 2005 )
2360724:DNA containing the wild-type p53 (Human Placental DNA) was always included as controls
2360724:K-Ras codon 12 mutations were detected using the Bst NI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA, USA)
2360724:The best characterised Ras effectors are the Raf serine/threonine kinases ( A-Raf , B-Raf and Raf-1 ) that upregulate the MAP kinase cascade ( Kolch, 2000 )
2360724:We selected for study the mutational status of K-Ras , B-Raf and p53 and the epigenetic status of RASSF1A , E-Cadherin and p16INK4A 
2360724:All these findings suggest that alterations in the genes mostly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis are not always requested for tumour progression
2360724:When codon 12 is wild-type, the PCR product contains a restriction site for Bst NI, and digestion yields bands of 128 and 29?bp
2360724:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant neoplasm worldwide
2360724:Smith et al (2002) investigated K-Ras , p53 and APC in 106 cases and 10% CRC were reported free of molecular abnormalities
2360724:Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20?min at room temperature
2360724:Mutations in this gene increase the protein half-life and are often associated with protein overexpression in the nucleus ( Remvikos et al , 1990 )
2360724:Data analysis was performed using STATA9
2360724:This means that the genes under study can confer a more aggressive phenotype when molecular changes deregulate at least three of them
2360724:A stepwise increase in the number of methylated genes was observed with lesion progression through the stages of multistep colorectal carcinogenesis by Lee et al (2004) 
2360724:The forward primer creates the restriction site for Bst NI, which is lost when K-Ras is mutated at codon 12
2360724:Aberrant activation of K-Ras has been implicated in facilitating all aspects of a malignant phenotype, including proliferation, invasion and metastases by Ras effectors such as PIK3, Raf/MEK/ERK cascade and Rho GTPases
2360724:A set of genetic and epigenetic molecular abnormalities is a feature of primary M+ CRCs likely conferring the ability for tumour extracolic spread and determining markers for aggressive behaviour and potential therapeutic targets
2360724:Gonzalez-Aguilera et al (2004) found increased K-Ras mutations in tumours with advanced Duke's stage (A 22%, B 27%, C 38% and D 33%), particularly when grouping M+ (46%) vs M? tumours (26%)
2360724:Out of 202 tumours, RASSF1A was methylated in 40 (20%) tumours, the majority occurring in M+ tumours ( P =0.021)
2360724:It is known that p16INK4A expression in colon cancer cells is repressed by methylation at the CpG island of promoter, but in vivo silencing of p16INK4A methylation has not been widely investigated ( Kim et al , 2005a )
2360724:p16INK4A methylation was associated with B-Raf mutations ( P <0.001), RASSF1A ( P =0.004) and E-Cadherin ( P =0.040) methylation
2360724:This cooperation between Ras and other genes is likely to occur in CRC progression because, in our study, only 6% of tumours showed the exclusive presence of K-Ras mutation
2360724:As previously noted ( Rajagopalan et al , 2002 ; Yuen et al , 2002 ), K-Ras and B-Raf mutations appear to be mutually exclusive, confirming previous suggestions that they have similar biological targets in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase signalling pathway ( Yuen et al , 2002 )
2360724:Whether alterations in both these genes may be able to confer a more aggressive phenotype remains to be established in larger series
2360724:As a result, multiple Ras effector pathways, which control fundamental biological processes such as proliferation, apoptosis and cell motility become constitutively activated and/or deregulated ( Pollock et al , 2005 )
2360724:Therefore, the less expensive, quick and efficient way to detect p53 mutations is to associate an abnormal SSCP pattern with the nuclear immunocytochemical detection of the gene product
2360724:Digested products were visualised by electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gels (containing 0.5? ? g?ml?1 ethidium bromide)
2360724:Among the variables associated with M+ cancers in univariate analysis ( K-Ras mutation, p16INK4A methylation, RASSF1A methylation, younger age and grading), multivariate analysis showed that only K-Ras mutations (OR 2.98, 95% CI, 1.37�6.46, P =0.006), p16INK4A methylation (OR 4.58, 95% CI, 2.14�9.76, P <0.001) and younger age (OR 0.95, 95% CI, 0.92�0.98, P <0.001) retained a statistically significant value
2360724:K-Ras has been also implicated in the process of tumour invasion and metastasis ( Giehl, 2005 )
2360724:DNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and 200?ng were used as a template for each PCR amplification
2360724:For SSCP analysis, PCR product was mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer containing 100% formamide (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA), 0.05% xylene cyanol (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA), and 0.05% bromphenol blue (Amersham Bioscience Corporation, Buckinghamshire, UK); heated at 96�C for 10?min and put on ice before being loaded on 37.5% TBE polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed for 1?h at 100?V and 4�5?h at 300?V
2360724:Figure 1 of Supplementary Appendix available on the BJC website illustrates an example of methylated and unmethylated PCR products
2360724:Whether E-Cadherin methylation and K-Ras mutation cooperate in right side colonic carcinogenesis and progression have to be confirmed in larger series
2360724:Positive (SW480 cell line) and negative controls (Human Placental DNA) for the mutation and controls for carryover DNA contamination were included in every experiment
2360724:Special care was taken to directly load the samples at high temperature (70�C) and in the presence of formamide (0.2%) to avoid reannealing of the restricted products ( Tsp RI leaves a nine-base 3? overhang)
2360724:We elected to study and to compare two homogeneous groups of CRC cases, namely those invading through muscolaris mucosa into subsierosa (or into nonperitonealised pericolic or perirectal tissues) with and without lymph nodes and/or liver metastases
2360724:Previous studies targeted to ascertain the molecular progression of CRC investigated genetic abnormalities of proto-oncogenes ( K-Ras ) and tumour suppressor genes ( p53 and APC ) or, alternatively, molecular epigenetic changes ( E-Cadherin , p16INK4A , DAPK, RASSF1A and APC ) ( Smith et al , 2002 ; Lee et al , 2004 )
2360724:The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin (Harris Hematoxylin, DiaPath, Microstain Division, Martinengo, BG, Italy)
2360724:These data are in agreement with previous studies examining different sets of genes
2360724:Seven cases (3%) showed B-Raf mutation but none of these had a coincidental mutation in the K-Ras gene nor a statistical association with the other clinico-pathological variables
2360724:Our study showed that coincidental methylation of the three genes ( RASSF1A , E-Cadherin and p16INK4A ) was restricted to M+ tumours ( P =0.042)
2360724:Primary mouse monoclonal antibody was applied for 1?h at room temperature
2360724:Davies et al (2002) recently reported that B-Raf mutations play a pivotal role in the oncogenesis of melanoma and colorectal carcinoma
2360724:Paraffin blocks were cut into several 2? ? m sections
2360724:The gels were silver stained with DNA Silver Staining Kit (Amersham Bioscience Corporation, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's recommendations
2360724:All variables found to have a P -value ?0.1 in the univariate evaluation were considered to be candidates for a subsequent stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis
2360724:No association was found in cases showing both genetic and phenotypic p53 abnormalities with the clinico-pathological parameters under study
2360724:After manual dissection, DNA was extracted from the unstained section of the malignant tissue as described previously ( Roncalli et al , 2002 )
2360724:Briefly, 200?ng of DNA were used as template for the first PCR, which consisted of a 50? ? l volume containing Taq DNA polymerase (1?U; Finnzyme, Espoo, Finland), deoxynucleotide triphosphates (0.2?m M ; Finnzyme, Espoo, Finland), reaction buffer (5? ? l; Finnzyme, Espoo, Finland), the primers forward (0.2?pmol? ? l?1; Proligo, Boulder, CO, USA): 5?-ACTGAATATAAACTTGTGGTAGTTGGACCT-3? and reverse (0.2?pmol? ? l?1; Proligo, Boulder, CO, USA): 5?-TCAAAAGAATGGTCCTGCACCAG-3?
2360724:Differences in frequencies of variables were tested using the ? 2 test (Pearson or Fisher, if appropriate), and differences in mean levels of variables were tested using the t -test
2360724:Twenty microlitres of the PCR reaction were then digested with Bst NI for 4?h at 60�C in a total volume of 50? ? l
2360724:Unmethylated (Human Placental DNA) and methylated DNA (LoVo, COLO320 and HepG2 cell lines for RASSF1A, E-Cadherin and p16INK4A , respectively) were used as MSP controls
2360724:Recently, some authors proposed that epithelial cells with activated Ras signalling require the cooperation of other signalling pathway to became metastogenic ( Grunert et al , 2003 ) and the oncogenic Ras is thought to cooperates with several other proto-oncogenes such as p53 and p16INK4A ( Serrano et al , 1996 ; Aguirre et al , 2003 )
2360724:An elongation of 10?min at 72�C followed the last cycle; at the end, samples were kept at 4�C
2360724:Polymerase chain reaction products were analysed on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide (0.5? ? g?ml?1), and visualised under UV illumination
2360724:The p16INK4A product, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, is capable of preventing Rb phosphorylation, thus blocking cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle ( Serrano et al , 1996 )
2360724:Polymerase chain reaction was performed separately with methylation-specific primers (0.12?pmol? ? l?1; Proligo, Boulder, CO, USA) and unmethylation primers (0.12?pmol? ? l?1; Proligo, Boulder, CO, USA) for each gene ( Supplementary Appendix, Table 1 )
2360724:Interestingly, in the present study, younger age was statistically associated to M+ tumours
2360724:This study includes 202 consecutive primary advanced metastatic and nonmetastatic CRCs surgically removed from 1997 to 2002
2360724:Overall, out of 202 tumours, 34 (17%) did not show any molecular change, 125 (62%) had one or two and 43 (21%) three or more
2360724:To analyse p53 expression, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections (2? ? m) were used, deparaffinised and exposed to an antigen retrieval system (1?m M EDTA, pH 8, and 98�C for 30?min) before being incubated with the specific p53 antibody (1:1000, Ab-2, Calbiochem; Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA, USA)
2360724:All cases showing PCR products for methylated DNA sequences also exhibited unmethylated DNA sequences, which was related to tumour heterogeneity or to the occurrence of intermingled non-neoplastic cells
2360724:Data were described as number and percentage or means and s.d., whether appropriate
2360724:The epigenetic profile of RASSF1A , E-Cadherin and p16INK4A in CRC is shown in Table 2b 
2360724:This protein can induce cycle arrest by cyclin D1 inhibition
2360724:Coincidental alterations of K-Ras and p16INK4A were mainly found in M+ tumours (2/67 M? tumours vs 17/139 M+ tumours; P =0.034), suggesting that abnormalities in these pathways could cooperate for a more aggressive phenotype, as previously supported by Serrano et al (1997 )
2360724:In such a way, the only significant morphological and biological variable between the two groups was the presence of metastatic deposits
2360724:Samples were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
2360724:Immunoperoxidase staining, using diaminobenzidine as chromogen, was carried out (DAB+chromogen X-50, ChemMate, DAKOCytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA)
2360724:An abnormal SSCP pattern coincidental with p53 nuclear immunoreactivity was taken as indicative of cases with p53 mutation
2360724:RASSF1A , E-Cadherin and p16INK4A methylation was documented in 20, 44 and 33% of the cases with p16INK4A significantly associated with metastatic tumours ( P =0.001)
2360724:K-Ras , B-Raf and p53 mutations were detected in 27, 3 and 32% of the cases, with K-Ras mutations significantly associated with metastatic tumour ( P =0.019)
2360724:The majority of analysed samples exhibited one specific B-Raf alteration that caused the exchange of valine to glutamate, a negatively charged amino acid, at position 599 (V599E) in the kinase domain of the protein
2360724:Table 1 reports the main clinico-pathological features of the series
2360724:By SSCP we identified samples with altered p53 migratory pattern, by gene mutation or polymorphism
2360724:Another focus of this study was to examine the interactions between genetic and epigenetic alterations in the induction of a metastogenic phenotype
2360724:The model of CRC relies upon the sequential accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes but, in our study, 17% of cases had no abnormalities in the investigated genes ( K-Ras , B-Raf , p53 , RASSF1A , E-Cadherin , p16INK4A )
2360724:Recently, it has been shown that loss of E-Cadherin expression in a transgenic mouse model is associated with the development of invasive colorectal carcinoma from well-differentiated adenomas ( Wheeler et al , 2001 )
2360724:The p53 suppressor gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle and apoptosis
2360724:This is likely due to internal selection for surgical treatment, being the older age a limiting factor for radical surgical resection ( Leporrier et al , 2006 )
2360724:B-Raf was rarely found mutated in our cases and never in conjunction with K-Ras 
2360724:Mutations at codon 12 of the K-Ras gene and at codon 599 of the B-Raf gene were detected by PCR�RFLP that identifies codon 12 and 599 mutations but not the specifically altered nucleotide
2360724:The primers (0.4?pmol? ? l?1; Proligo, Boulder, CO, USA) and the condition for PCR are described in the Table 1 of Supplementary Appendix available on the BJC website
2360724:Sequential and additional genetic alterations affecting several proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes have been recognised in the pathogenesis of CRC
2360724:The mutational status of K-Ras , B-Raf and p53 in 202 cases of CRC is shown in Table 2a 
2360724:In the latter (?3 abnormalities) group, the most frequent combination of genes was one genetic and two epigenetic alterations, particularly K-Ras mutations (18/34=53%), with gene methylation equally affecting the three genes under study ( RASSF1A , E-Cadherin and p16INK4A )
2360724:On the other hand, the mere immunocytochemical detection of p53 gene product may also be due to an increased protein stabilisation uncoupled from mutation ( Cripps et al , 1994 )
2360724:DNA containing the wild-type (Human Placental DNA) or the mutated T1976 sequence (HT29 cell line) was always included as controls
2360724:A small proportion of cases (10/202=5%) showed both K-Ras mutations and RASSF1A methylation; interestingly all these cases were M+ ( P =0.016)
2360724:K-Ras , p53 and B-Raf mutations and RASSF1A , E-Cadherin and p16INK4A promoter methylation were investigated in 202 CRCs with and without lymph node and/or liver metastasis, to assess whether gene abnormalities are related to a metastogenic phenotype
2360724:Chiang et al (2004) also demonstrated that the three key mutations (APC, K-Ras and p53 ) are rarely coincidental in 122 sporadic CRCs
2360724:Among tumour suppressor genes showing DNA methylation, p16INK4A seems to play a major role in the metastogenic phenotype of primary CRCs
2360724:E-Cadherin belongs to a family of Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules that mediate intercellular contacts critical to morphogenesis and the maintenance of tissue structure ( Takeichi, 1995 )
2360724:We found 27% K-Ras mutations in the whole series and a statistical association with M+ tumours (univariate analysis P =0.016; multivariate analysis P =0.019), suggesting K-Ras activation as an important determinant of extracolic tumour spread
2360724:Cycling conditions of the first PCR were as follows: initial denaturation (4?min at 94�C), followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (30?s at 94�C), annealing (15?s at 53�C), and elongation (30?s at 72�C)
2360724:p16INK4A methylation was significantly associated with M+ tumours ( P <0.001)
2360724:A strong correlation between staging and p16INK4A methylation was found also by Yi et al (2001) ; loss of p16INK4A expression has been previously associated with lymph-node metastases ( Kim et al , 2005a ) and more advanced stage ( Jeong et al , 2005 )
2360724:The target was to establish in CRCs if and which genetic and epigenetic molecular abnormalities, among a number of selected genes, are associated to a metastogenic phenotype
2360724:We used both SSCP and immunohistochemistry
2360724:E-Cadherin promoter methylation was prevalent in the right colon (univariate analysis P =0.011; multivariate analysis P =0.007), so that coincidental K-Ras mutations and E-Cadherin methylation frequently occurred in proximal (27%) rather than left colon (5%) and rectum (8%) ( P <0.001)
2360724:Reactive sites were identified with secondary antibody (HRP rabbit/mouse, ChemMate DAKO Envision, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 30?min at room temperature
2360724:Out of 202 cases, E-Cadherin methylation was detected in 88 (44%) cases
2360724:By univariate analysis, K-Ras mutations were significantly associated with M+ tumours ( P =0.016) and more frequent detectable in the right side ( P =0.088)
2360724:Modified DNA was purified using the Wizard DNA purification resin according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Milano, Italy) and eluted into 50? ? l of water
2360724:Colorectal cancer (CRC) develops as multistep process, which involves genetic and epigenetic alterations
2360724:Indeed, an altered SSCP pattern may be merely related to gene polymorphism and as such being not indicative of an abnormally mutated gene
2360724:If there is a mutation in either of the first two bases of codon 12, the mutant PCR fragment will not be cut and will remain at its original size of 157?bp
2360724:Less known are the molecular events responsible for the progression and metastatisation of CRC; it is reasonable that the molecular profile of primary but yet metastatic CRC may be helpful to understand the molecular basis of extracolic tumour spread and to define therapeutic strategies against �metastogenic' genes
2360724:An altered SSCP pattern was identified in 91 (45%) out of 202 samples, whereas p53 nuclear immunoreactivity was detected in 115 (57%) out of 202 cases
2360724:Different results were reported by Goh et al (1999) that used only SSCP to detect p53 mutations
2360724:Briefly, PCR fragments were generated from 200?ng of genomic DNA in a 50? ? l PCR reaction buffer
2360724:One section from each tissue was stained with hematoxylin�eosin to distinguish neoplastic tissue from the nonmalignant counterpart
2360724:DNA was resuspended in water and used immediately or stored at ?20�C
2360724:After incubation with the enzyme at 65�C overnight, the products were analysed on 3% agarose gels
2360724:Methylation was seen in 33% of the whole series and it was, like K-Ras mutation, significantly associated with a M+ phenotype (univariate analysis P =0.011; multivariate analysis P =0.001)
2360724:A P -value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant
2360724:p16INK4A methylation was more frequently detectable in p53 mutated cases ( P =0.075)
2360724:Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinised using 100% xylene (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) followed by 100% ethanol
2360724:Mutations that prevalently occur at codon 12, prevent efficient GTP-hydrolysis and thus render the protein in an activated state
2360724:The pellet was then resuspended in a buffer containing proteinase K (Finnzyme, Espoo, Finland), and DNA was extracted with phenol�chloroform (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) followed by ethanol precipitation
2360724:A coincidental abnormal SSCP migratory pattern and p53 nuclear immunoreactivity was documented in 65 (32%) out of 202 cases
2360724:p16INK4A gene is one of the most frequently inactivated tumour suppressor genes in human cancer ( Kamb et al , 1994 )
2360724:As previously reported ( Roncalli et al , 2002 ), 1? ? g of genomic DNA in a volume of 50? ? l was denatured by NaOH for 10?min at 37�C; 30? ? l of 10?m M hydroquinone (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) and 520? ? l of 3? M sodium bisulphite (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at pH 5, both freshly prepared, were added and mixed, and samples were incubated at 50�C for 16?h
2360724:Given that a fraction of M? CRCs (13%) already harbours three or more molecular changes, we are currently analysing this cohort to ascertain whether these cases will develop metachronous liver metastasis at an increase rate as compared to M? CRCs with <3 molecular changes
2360724:By inactivating various tumour suppressor genes, this epigenetic modification can affect many important cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis
2360724:RASSF1 proteins are potential Ras effectors and the major isoform, RASSF1A , is an important human tumour suppressor protein acting at G1/S phase of cell-cycle progression ( Dammann et al , 2003 )
2360724:In conclusion, analysis of a panel of genes provided to detect some genetic and epigenetic molecular differences between M+ and M? primary CRCs
2360724:Interestingly, it has been shown that this alteration causes the growth of carcinoma cell lines independent from Ras activation
2360724:Altogether, these results suggest that p16INK4A methylation might link to a more malignant phenotype in CRC; interestingly Liang et al (1999) recently reported an association between p16INK4A methylation and shorter survival of CRC
2360724:In conclusion, this analysis provided to detect some molecular differences between primary metastatic and nonmetastatic CRCs, with K-Ras and p16INK4A statistically altered in metastatic tumours; particular gene combinations, such as coincidental K-Ras mutation with two methylated genes are associated to a metastogenic phenotype
2360724:E-Cadherin methylation was more frequently detectable in the right colon ( P =0.011) and in older patients ( P =0.002)
2360724:Mutations in this gene constitute some of the most frequently occurring genetic changes at human malignancies and are thought to be late development in the adenoma�carcinoma sequence in CRC ( Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990 )
2360724:Finally, precipitated DNA was resuspended in 100? ? l of water
2360724:E-Cadherin methylation was also associated with RASSF1A methylation ( P =0.047)
2360724:During the last decade, epigenetic changes have been reported in many cancers and they are now recognised to be at least as common as genetic changes
2360724:Accordingly, these two groups will be referred to throughout the paper as metastatic (M+) and nonmetastatic (M?) tumours
2360724:Regardless the type of molecular abnormalities, 68 cases (34%) showed one molecular alteration, 57 cases (28%) two molecular alterations and 43 cases (21%) ?3 molecular alterations
2360724:No statistical association was seen between M+ and M? CRCs showing one or two gene alterations
2360724:Notably, patients showing three methylated genes were also of older age (73.83 vs 65.60 years; P =0.017), in keeping with the suggestion put forwards by Toyota and Issa (1999 ) that age-related methylation might contribute to the sharp increase in cancer risk after the age of 60 years
2360724:Regardless the type of molecular abnormalities, tumours with three or more but not those with less than three, were significantly more prevalent in the group of M+ tumours ( P =0.023)
2360724:Supplementary information accompanies the paper on British Journal of Cancer website ( http://www.nature.com/bjc )
2361800:These mutation data are in stark contrast to that for cutaneous melanoma, and would appear to suggest that the MAPK pathway is unlikely to play a significant role in uveal melanoma development
2361800:In this study, we performed mutation analysis of the RAS and BRAF genes in a panel of 11 uveal melanoma cell lines and 19 primary uveal melanoma tumours
2361800:These data suggest that activation of the MAPK pathway is commonly involved in the development of uveal melanoma, but occurs through a mechanism different to that of cutaneous melanoma
2361800:ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 expression in uveal melanoma cell lines (Mel 202, Ocm 1, Mel 285, Mel 290) cultured with (+) and without (?) serum (24?h)
2361800:We thus screened for activating mutations in the NRAS , HRAS , KRAS and BRAF genes in uveal melanoma cell lines and primary uveal melanomas
2361800:Figure 2 shows that there is no significant influence of serum on the activity of ERK1/2 in these cell lines, as reported recently by Calipel et al (2003) 
2361800:An initial 12?min denaturation at 94�C and a final 3?min extension at 72�C were also employed
2361800:Protein lysates from the uveal melanoma cell lines were separated on 12.5% SDS�PAGE gels and the proteins transferred to Hybond-polyvinyldifluoride membranes (Amersham biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK)
2361800:The research protocol followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki 1964; ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects)
2361800:In the active GTP-bound state, RAS activates a number of downstream signalling cascades involved in controlling cell growth and behaviour
2361800:Sections were rinsed briefly in PBS and imbedded with Vectashield (Vecta Shield H1000, Brunschwig, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
2361800:In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, there is no evidence that BRAF mutations are involved in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in uveal melanoma, although there is increasing evidence that this pathway is activated frequently in the latter tumours
2361800:Four of these samples showed a spindle cell type, one an epithelioid cell type and 14 had a mixed population of cells
2361800:Taken together, these data suggest that while a BRAF mutation is not required for uveal melanoma development in vivo , such mutations confer a cellular growth advantage and are hence selected if they occur in cell lines cultured in vitro 
2361800:However, on the contrary, by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, we have found substantial evidence for activation of the MAPK pathway, in the absence of serum, in the majority of uveal melanoma samples � both cell lines and primary uveal melanoma specimens
2361800:PCR primers used for amplifying parts of the BRAF and RAS genes in the primary tumour samples are also listed in Table 1 
2361800:Recently, an interaction has been found between the MAPK and the PTEN pathways, both frequently activated in parallel to promote cutaneous melanoma development ( Tsao et al , 2004 )
2361800:No background fluorescence of cy3 was observed
2361800:The scoring system for each antibody cannot be compared between antibodies since the antibodies recognise different epitopes and with different affinities; therefore, the staining intensity on Western or by immunohistochemistry is relative only to the other samples for the particular antibody used
2361800:The cell lines Ocm 1 and Ocm 3 were provided by Dr Kan-Mitchell ( Kan-Mitchell et al , 1989 ) and cell lines 92.1 and 92.2, derived from the same primary tumour were established in our own laboratory ( de Waard-Siebinga et al , 1995 )
2361800:Initially, RAS interacts with and activates the serine/threonine protein kinase BRAF that acts in the MAPK pathway to transduce regulatory signals from RAS to mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase kinase (MEK1/2)
2361800:The most frequently found mutation in BRAF (V599E) consists of a 1796T ? A transversion in exon 15 ( Davies et al , 2002 )
2361800:In order to assess the level of expression and the activation (by phosphorylation) of members of the MAPK pathway downstream of RAS and BRAF , Western blot analysis was performed on uveal melanoma cell lines ( Table 2A )
2361800:The signal transducer MEK1/2 phosphorylates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2, p44/42), leading to the activation of these kinases, which in turn activate a variety of transcription factors, including ELK1, again through phosphorylation
2361800:In total, 11 uveal melanoma cell lines, derived from primary uveal melanomas (Mel202, Mel 285, Mel 270, Mel 290, Ocm 1, Ocm 3, 92.1, 92.2) or uveal melanoma metastases (Omm 1 Omm 1.3 and Omm 1.5), were analysed
2361800:NG is a recipient of an Aspasia fellowship of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research
2361800:Of the primary tumours, eight were located in the choroid and 11 in both the choroid and ciliary body
2361800:DNA was extracted from each cell line using an adaptation of the salting-out method ( Miller et al , 1988 )
2361800:Primers used to amplify parts of the BRAF and RAS genes are given in Table 1 
2361800:The expression levels of the downstream members of RAS and BRAF are presented in Figure 1 
2361800:Actin levels were assessed as a loading control
2361800:Various other mutations have been described in this exon in melanocytic tumours (V599D ( Brose et al , 2002 ; Davies et al , 2002 ; Pollock et al , 2003 ); V599K ( Pollock et al , 2003 , Uribe et al , 2003 ); V599R ( Pollock et al , 2003 ); K600E ( Brose et al , 2002 , Satyamoorthy et al , 2003 ))
2361800:Interobserver disagreement did not exceed one category
2361800:A nuclear staining was preformed by incubating the sections for 5?min with 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilacetate (DAPI, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands, #D-3571) 1?:?500
2361800:Omm 1, obtained from a subcutaneous metastasis, was established by Dr Luyten ( Luyten et al , 1996 )
2361800:Similarly, our observation of a complete lack of BRAF mutations in primary uveal tumours mirrors the findings of several recent reports ( Cohen et al , 2003 ; Cruz et al , 2003 ; Edmunds et al , 2003 ; Rimoldi et al , 2003 ; Weber et al , 2003 ; Kilic et al , 2004 )
2361800:In keeping with this observation, these two cell lines also have the highest levels of phosphorylated-ERK
2361800:Of the 11 uveal melanoma cell lines under study, only one cell line (Ocm 1) carried a BRAF mutation, the common V599E (also described by Calipel et al and Kilic et al )
2361800:It is somewhat surprising therefore that three out of three uveal melanoma cell lines studied by Calipel et al (2003) carried the V599E mutation in BRAF , especially since only one out of 11 cell lines in the panel we analysed was found to have this mutation
2361800:Despite this, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), ERK and ELK were constitutively activated in all samples
2361800:In seven of the 19 primary tumours, less than 5% of the tumour cells stained positively for ERK1/2 and nine tumours for phosphorylated ERK1/2
2361800:Recently, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been found to play an important role in melanocytic neoplasia ( Cohen et al , 2002 ; Satyamoorthy et al , 2003 )
2361800:It is possible that MAPK activation is such a crucial requirement for uveal melanoma development because it similarly provides survival, and/or antiapoptotic signals, necessary for tumour cell growth and maintenance
2361800:Interestingly, compared to the phosphorylation status of these members in Ocm 1, most cell lines show activation of MEK, ERK and ELK; however, these cell lines show this activation in the absence of mutations in the upstream RAS and BRAF genes
2361800:Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94�C for 45?s, annealing at 65�57�C for 90?s and extension at 72�C for 90?s
2361800:In our study, none of the cell lines or primary tumours carried mutations in any of the three RAS genes (N, H and K), a finding consistent with a previous report ( Soparker et al , 1993 )
2361800:Sequence analysis was performed on exons 11�15 of BRAF , and exons 1 and 2 of the three RAS family members, which cover the positions of all known mutations of these genes in all types of cancer
2361800:Table 3 contains a summary of published reports on RAS and BRAF mutations, as well as studies on other members of the MAPK pathway, in uveal melanomas
2361800:A similar lack of effect of serum on influencing the level of phospho-ERK1/2 was seen for each of the other uveal melanoma cell lines (data not shown).
2361800:All samples were derived from tumours with a diameter greater than 12?ml and a prominence greater than 6?ml
2361800:The latter consist of a 1352A ? C transversion (K438Q) ( Brose et al , 2002 ), a 1402G ? A transition (G468R) and a 1402/1403GG ? TC tandem transversion ( Gorden et al , 2003 ), a 1394G ? A transition (G465E) and a 1394G ? C transversion (G465A) ( Davies et al , 2002 )
2361800:It is tempting to speculate that MAPK activation in uveal melanoma may arise via crosstalk with the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway, possibly as a consequence of mutation of some of its components (other than PTEN, which is not mutated in this tumour type)
2361800:Since cutaneous and uveal melanoma both arise from neural crest-derived melanocytes, we sought to assess whether the MAPK pathway was similarly activated in melanoma of the uvea
2361800:All primary tumour specimens were wild type for BRAF 
2361800:FvN is supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and by the Dutch Cancer Society
2361800:An initial 12?min denaturation step at 94�C and a final 3?min extension at 72�C were also used
2361800:Of three RAS genes found to be activated by mutation in human tumours, NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral (v- ras ) oncogene homologue) is most commonly mutated in cutaneous melanomas ( van Elsas et al , 1996 )
2361800:Sections were rinsed with PBS three times and incubated for 20?min with Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands, #A22287) at a 1?:?40 dilution
2361800:For instance, the tumour suppressor gene PTEN , encoding a dual-specific phosphatase and a member of the PI3-AKT pathway, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous melanoma ( Guldberg et al , 1997 ; Stahl et al , 2003 ), whereas no mutations in this gene have been found in uveal melanoma ( Naus et al , 2000 )
2361800:For the RAS genes, DNA was amplified using QIAGEN Taq polymerase as described above, but PCR involved a �touchdown' thermal cycling routine of two cycles at each annealing temperature, decreasing by steps of 2�C, followed by 25 cycles at the lowest temperature
2361800:Our data thus support the notion that activation of MAPK is indeed involved in the development of uveal melanoma, but occurs via a different mechanism(s) to that in the majority of cutaneous melanomas
2361800:All other mutations have been described in exon 11
2361800:Our study is the only study design providing mutation information on all RAS members and expression data on a wide range of participants in the MAPK pathway
2361800:Mel 202, Mel 285, Mel 270, Mel 290 and the two cell lines derived from metastases (Omm 1.3 and Omm 1.5) were kindly provided by Dr BR Ksander (Schepens Eye Institute, Boston, MA, USA)
2361800:Expression levels of members of the MAPK pathway downstream of RAS and BRAF in 11 uveal melanoma cell lines
2361800:The sections were washed three times and incubated with cy3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG or with cy3-conjugated AffiniPure rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA, USA #111-165-003 and #315-165-003) both diluted 1?:?500, respectively, during 1?h at room temperature
2361800:Notable exceptions are hypermethylation of CDKN2A , which is more common in tumours from patients who develop metastatic disease ( van der Velden et al , 2001 ), and germline BRCA2 gene mutations, which occur in 3% of patients younger than 50 years of age ( Scott et al , 2002 )
2361800:Including the results of our study, to date not a single BRAF mutation has been found in a total of 276 primary or secondary uveal melanoma samples ( Table 3 )
2361800:Reactions for BRAF contained 200 ng of DNA, QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany) PCR buffer (10 � concentrated, containing Tris-Cl, KCl, (NH4)2SO4, 15?m M MgCl2; pH 8.7), Q solution (PCR enhancer), 20?pmol? ? l?1 of each primer, 2?m M of each dNTP and 1.25?U of QIAGEN Taq polymerase
2361800:No mutations were found in the NRAS , HRAS or KRAS genes, in both the cell lines and primary tissue
2361800:Amplification involved 35 cycles of denaturation at 94�C for 45?s, annealing at 56�C for 90?s, and extension at 72�C for 90?s
2361800:The RAS and BRAF PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems (ABI) BigDye version 3 reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions using 3.2?pmol? ? l?1 of primer
2361800:All BRAF mutations in cutaneous pigmented neoplasms occur within the kinase domain
2361800:In response to the constitutively activating BRAF mutation in Ocm 1, downstream members of the MAPK pathway show activation (phosphorylated MEK, ERK and ELK)
2361800:Hence, the search for other genes and molecular pathways involved in uveal melanoma development is of great significance
2361800:RNA was primed with random primers and reverse transcribed into cDNA in a 20? ? l reaction volume containing 200?U Superscript II (MMV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Inc., Breda, The Netherlands)
2361800:Despite the lack of mutations in the RAS and BRAF genes in this set of uveal melanomas, it is noteworthy that we observed phosphorylated (active) ERK1/2 expression in 10 of 19 tumours
2361800:Immunofluorescence results of total and phospho-ERK1/2 on a panel of 19 fresh frozen uveal melanoma sections are listed in Table 2 (B) 
2361800:Up to half of all patients die from metastatic disease ( Diener-West et al , 1992 )
2361800:Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or anti-goat secondary antibodies for 1?h at room temperature to visualise protein bands
2361800:Acetone-fixed 10? ? m sections of 19 fresh frozen uveal melanomas were washed three times in PBS (pH=7.2) and were incubated with anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK 1/2 antibodies (Cell Signalling Technology, Beverly MA, USA, #9102 and #9106, respectively), both diluted 1?:?100 in PBS with 1% BSA and 2% normal human serum (NHS) at 4�C
2361800:We thank Dr AD Singh for generously providing a panel of fresh frozen primary uveal melanoma specimens, Dr M Bernsen and P Rombout for the cutaneaous melanoma sections (Department of Pathology, University Medical Centre Nijmegen) and Drs Ksander and Kan-Mitchell for providing some of the cell lines
2361800:Thus, mutation analysis of the PI3K and AKT gene families in uveal melanomas seems warranted
2361800:In spite of several known prognostic markers (pathologic and genetic), such as tumour cell type, diameter, localisation and cytogenetic abnormalities, little is known about specific genes associated with predisposition and progression in uveal melanoma ( Mooy and de Jong, 1996 ; Sisley et al , 1997 )
2361800:After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS-Tween solution, the membranes were probed overnight at 4�C with the following primary antibodies specific to each antigen: phospho-MEK1/2 (dilution 1?:?1000), phospho-ERK1/2 (p44/42) (#9106, dilution 1?:?5000), total ERK1/2 (#9102, dilution 1?:?1000) and phospho-ELK1 (dilution 1?:?1000) antibody (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Hertfordshire, UK)
2361800:The slides were examined by two observers independently
2361800:The frequency of BRAF mutations varies from 8 to 83% depending on the anatomic site of the lesion and its histogenic subtype
2361800:This conclusion has significant ramifications for the development of rational therapies to treat uveal melanoma as it implies that general inhibitors of the pathway may still be effective even though the tumours do not have mutations of RAS or BRAF 
2361800:Sequencing products were precipitated using 75% isopropanol and were run on an ABI 377 automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
2361800:Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumour in adults, with an annual incidence of 6�8 new cases per million among Caucasian populations
2361800:In the uveal melanoma cell lines and primary uveal melanomas analysed in our study, only cell line Ocm 1 carried a mutation in BRAF (V599E), thus confirming the documentation of a mutation in this cell line by Calipel et al (2003) and Kilic et al (2004) 
2361800:Levels of expression of the downstream members were not different in the two cell lines derived from the same primary tumour (92.1 and 92.2), except for phosphorylated MEK, indicating that there had been little clonal divergence between the cell populations during in vitro culturing
2361800:Furthermore, it is not surprising that since they activate the same pathway, mutations in NRAS and BRAF are almost mutually exclusive ( Brose et al , 2002 ; Davies et al , 2002 ; Alsina et al , 2003 ; Dong et al , 2003 ; Gorden et al , 2003 ; Kumar et al , 2003a , 2003b ; Omholt et al , 2003 ; Pollock et al , 2003 ; Satyamoorthy et al , 2003 ; Reifenberger et al , 2004 ; Tsao et al , 2004 )
2361800:The levels of total ERK were remarkably similar across all cell lines, with the exception of two cell lines Mel 285 and Mel 290, which had significantly higher levels of total ERK than the others
2361800:In addition, we analysed 19 primary fresh frozen uveal melanomas
2361800:There was no significant association between ERK1/2 activation and tumour location or cell type
2361800:No mutations were found in any of the three RAS gene family members and only one cell line carried a BRAF mutation (V599E)
2361800:For each specimen, the fluorescence of cy3 was determined in three different microscope fields (Leica DMRXA microscope, Leica Microsystems, Rijswijk, The Netherlands)
2361800:This frequent MAPK pathway activation in uveal melanoma, independent of RAS and BRAF mutations, has also been reported recently by others ( Rimoldi et al , 2003 ; Weber et al , 2003 ;), but the mechanism is unknown
2361800:A touchdown PCR procedure for BRAF was followed as described above and a fixed annealing temperature of 57�C with a total of 38 cycles was used for the RAS genes followed by a final elongation step of 10?min
2361800:Activation of this pathway in cutaneous melanocytes has been shown to occur by a variety of mechanisms, including autocrine growth factor stimulation and mutation of the RAS or BRAF genes
2361800:PCR products of all samples were electrophoresed through 1.5% TAE/agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide, excised and purified using a QIAGEN QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
2361800:This work was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, the �Rotterdamse Vereniging Blindenbelangen' and the �Landelijke Stichting voor Blinden en Slechtzienden'
2361800:Notably, the frequency of BRAF mutations is also high in benign melanocytic naevi ( Dong et al , 2003 ; Pollock et al , 2003 ; Uribe et al , 2003 ; Yazdi et al , 2003 ), indicating that constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway is an early event in melanomagenesis
2361800:Percentages were then categorised as either negative <5% (+/?), very weakly positive 5�25% (+), weakly positive 26�50% (++), moderately positive 51�75% (+++) or highly positive 76�100% (++++)
2361800:It has emerged that BRAF (v- raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1) is very frequently activated by mutation in cutaneous melanomas ( Brose et al , 2002 ; Davies et al , 2002 ; Alsina et al , 2003 ; Dong et al , 2003 ; Gorden et al , 2003 ; Kumar et al , 2003a , 2003b ; Maldonado et al , 2003 ; Omholt et al , 2003 ; Pollock et al , 2003 ; Rimoldi et al , 2003 ; Satyamoorthy et al , 2003 ; Weber et al , 2003 ; Cohen et al , 2004 ; Reifenberger et al , 2004 ; Shinozaki et al , 2004 ; Tsao et al , 2004 )
2361800:In contrast to uveal melanoma, the influence of specific pathways in cutaneous melanoma, which shares the same embryonic origin, is better defined
2361800:Interestingly, Graells et al (2004) demonstrated that the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is frequently highly expressed in uveal melanoma ( Stitt et al , 1998 ; Sheidow et al , 2000 ), could operate in cutaneous melanoma as a survival factor through increasing MAPK and PI3K pathway activity
2361800:Although many uveal melanoma samples have been studied for BRAF and NRAS mutations, few have been analysed for MAPK activation and there is the implicit assumption that this pathway is not involved in uveal melanoma genesis
2361800:In addition, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on downstream members of the MAPK pathway in order to assess the contribution of each of these components
2361800:The melanoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland) medium, supplemented with 3?m M L -glutamine (Gibco), 2% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA)
2361800:An antibody against actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California, USA) was used as a loading control
2361800:All cell cultures were incubated at 37�C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere
2361800:The number of positively stained tumour cells was estimated for the two antibodies and expressed as the percentage of the total number of tumour cells in the analysed section
2361800:In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis with MEK, ERK and ELK antibodies both on cell lines and/or primary tumours to assess the level of expression and degree of activation of these proteins in order to provide insight into the involvement of this pathway in the development of uveal melanoma
2361800:From 19 fresh frozen uveal melanoma samples, total RNA was extracted with RNeasy kits as described by the manufacturer (QIAGEN)
2361800:Sections are washed three times with PBS
2686726:An obvious question is whether skin rash and KRAS are independent predictors
2686726:They found that amphiregulin and epiregulin expression influenced RR and OS in patients with KRAS WT tumors, but not in patients with KRAS MT tumors, and concluded that the combined use of these markers may allow improved prediction of outcome to cetuximab plus irinotecan
2686726:When EGF ligand binds to the extracellular part of the EGFR receptor, the receptor dimerizes and its enzymatic activity is activated, resulting in phosphorylation of the intracellular domain
2686726:In fact, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approved panitumumab only for patients with KRAS wild-type tumors
2686726:KRAS MT status did not show an impact on tumor response in the report from Moroni and colleagues [ 7 ], but the patient numbers in this study were very low, with only 5 patients each showing KRAS WT and KRAS MT status
2686726:Randomized prospective trials are not needed nor are they ethical to prove this concept further
2686726:However, if cetuximab is to be continued as a component in this trial, KRAS testing should be required
2686726:Monoclonal antibodies that target EGFR can be effective as anticancer therapy in several ways
2686726:We have made significant progress in the management of CRC, and to some degree, we have been successful in converting metastatic CRC to a chronic disease state
2686726:The study reported by Di Fiore and colleagues [ 11 ] underscores the importance of using sensitive molecular methods to ensure efficient mutation detection
2686726:Moving forward, there are several issues, both immediate and long term, that need to be addressed: At least two large randomized phase III trials in the U.S
2686726:All authors contributed to writing the manuscript
2686726:In the three studies designed to compare outcomes from standard treatment with or without cetuximab [ 22 , 24 , 25 ], patients with KRAS MT tumors showed a decrease in TTP in the cetuximab-containing arm compared with the standard treatment arm, although the difference in each individual study did not reach statistical significance
2686726:This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited
2686726:To date, clinical activity has been assessed in over 2500 patients treated with cetuximab/panitumumab, either as a single agent or in combination with both FOFIRI and FOLOX chemotherapy, in both chemotherapy-refractory and chemotherapy-na�ve settings
2686726:Stoehlmacher and colleagues [ 16 ] evaluated the predictive value of KRAS mutations and polymorphisms of EGFR and IgG-Fc-receptor in 40 patients with metastatic CRC receiving cetuximab-containing chemotherapy (in combination with irinotecan, FOLFIRI, or FOLFOX)
2686726:To date, however, the overall effectiveness of targeted therapy in solid tumors has not been as robust as that achieved, for example, by Gleevec (imatinib) in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
2686726:The rate of GTP to GDP conversion can be sped up dramatically by an accessory protein of the Guanine nucleotide activating protein (GAP) class, for example RasGAP
2686726:Despite significant progress in the development of new therapies over the last decade, CRC remains one of the top three causes of cancer death in the United States, where it is estimated that 148,810 patients will be newly diagnosed with CRC in 2008, with 49,960 deaths from this disease [ 1 ]
2686726:Due to this heterogeneity, an agent targeting one particular pathway is unlikely to be effective in all patients
2686726:KRAS can also facilitate the release of bound nucleotide by binding to proteins of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) class, for example Soverall survival-1
2686726:Consistent with the findings of Tejpar et al., they found that patients with KRAS WT tumors and patients with tumors that express high levels of epiregulin and amphiregulin are more likely to have disease control and increased TTP with cetuximab
2686726:It is interesting to note here that KRAS status did not have an effect on TTP in the absence of treatment with the EGFR-targeting therapy, although KRAS MT appeared to be associated with reduced OS in both treatment groups
2686726:Recent data also suggest that genetic profiling can predict which patients may benefit from adjuvant therapy after resection of their breast cancers (e.g., Genomic Health's Oncotype DX� test, which profiles the expression of 21 genes and makes a prediction about the likelihood of disease recurrence)
2686726:For example, the targeted agent cetuximab as a single agent has a response rate of only about 10% in patients with irinotecan-refractory CRC [ 2 , 3 ]
2686726:Individualized therapies that are tailored to a patient's genetic composition and tests that can predict which therapy he/she will respond to will be of tremendous value for colorectal carcinoma (CRC)
2686726:EGFR is a member of the HER (ErbB) family of human epidermal growth factor receptors that can promote tumor cell proliferation in a variety of epithelial malignancies
2686726:In this study, 59 patients with previously treated metastatic CRC were treated with cetuximab plus either irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapies
2686726:The EGFR monoclonal antibodies target the extracellular domain of the receptor
2686726:It should be noted that, at least in the first line setting, there is a concern that cetuximab may actually have detrimental effects for patients with KRAS MT tumors
2686726:However, as second line therapy, while patients are randomized to study arms with or without bevacizumab, all patients receive cetuximab
2686726:SK contributed to discussion
2686726:Long before KRAS emerged as a predictive marker for responsiveness to EGFR monoclonal antibody targeted therapy, it was well known that skin rash was a very good surrogate marker for responsiveness to EGFR targeted therapies
2686726:Anti-estrogen treatment, an early type of targeted therapy, mainly benefits patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
2686726:SNaPshot and PCR-LCR assays confirmed the absence of KRAS mutations in the CR/PR patients
2686726:While the modification plan is still being formulated, it is almost certain that KRAS testing will be required and only patients with wild-type KRAS would be allowed for randomization
2686726:DZC, VK, YM, and KL assembled and analyzed the data
2686726:It has become clear that patients with colorectal cancer whose tumor has an activating mutation in KRAS do not respond to monoclonal antibody therapies targeting EGFR
2686726:Activating mutations of the KRAS gene have been widely studied as markers for cancer prognosis
2686726:The results demonstrated that, in patients with metastatic CRC after failure of irinotecan-based therapy, treatment efficacy could be improved by escalating the dose of cetuximab in combination with standard-regimen irinotecan compared with standard-dose cetuximab for patients with grade 0/1 skin reactions
2686726:In some cases, the antibody/receptor complex may also be immunogenic, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
2686726:To this end, we have taken a huge step forward with KRAS, and within the next decade, it is likely that we will see more and more biomarkers come into clinical practice to direct individualized treatment
2686726:TTP was reported in 6 studies, with a median TTP of 6.1 months (range 1.8 months � 7.9 months) in patients with KRAS WT tumors compared with 3.0 months (range 1.8 months � 3.7 months) in patients with KRAS MT tumors
2686726:Khamabata-Ford and colleagues [ 12 ] attempted to systemically identify markers that are associated with disease control in patients treated with cetuximab as a monotherapy
2686726:This was probably a forward-thinking design when it was conceived, because the EPIC study showed activity of cetuximab in second line therapy for irinotecan-na�ve patients
2686726:The studies in this field are being actively pursued
2686726:The EGFR molecules are 170 kd transmembrane glycoproteins: the extracellular domain has the ligand binding site and also contains specific sequences that are involved in dimerization, while the intracellular domain is a catalytic site that has tyrosine kinase activity
2686726:Therefore, improved response was mainly seen in the patients with wild-type KRAS tumors, while increased dose of cetuximab did not overcome reduced response in mutant KRAS tumors
2686726:However more data will be needed to incorporate these and other novel markers into clinical practice
2686726:Therefore, in this series of 59 patients with metastatic CRC, sequencing analysis supplemented by SNaPshot multiplex and PCR-LCR assays led to the detection of a KRAS mutation in 22 samples (37%), rather than the 11 samples (27%) with direct sequencing alone
2686726:One option would be to completely drop the cetuximab component and to only test the question of whether continuation of bevacizumab beyond progression on first line therapy is beneficial
2686726:Results from relevant studies published since 2005 and unpublished results presented at national meetings were retrieved and summarized
2686726:Across all studies, approximately one-third of patients (median 36%, range 24% � 44%) had KRAS MT tumors
2686726:Clearly, there is a need to identify those patients who are most likely to respond to a specific therapy
2686726:Subsequently, cellular effectors bind to phosphorylated residues of the intracellular domain and are activated, mainly through relocalization to the plasma membrane
2686726:For most solid tumors, on the other hand, although they may appear to be morphologically similar on microscopic examination, molecular studies can identify different genetic alterations in tumors from different patients
2686726:OS was reported in only one study [ 24 ], which noted a small increase in OS associated with KRAS WT compared with KRAS MT (22.2 months versus 19.1 months, respectively)
2686726:Overexpression of EGFR has been detected in many human cancers, including CRC
2686726:Several studies have suggested that the predictive value of KRAS in determining response to cetuximab-containing regimens may be improved by combining it with other predictive factors
2686726:In summary, under controlled conditions in these studies of first-line treatment in metastatic CRC, KRAS mutation was found to be a predictive marker for lack of response to cetuximab treatment, either alone or in combination with irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapies
2686726:There is a pressing need to develop novel therapies for this group of patients
2686726:Most recently, interim results from the PRECEPT study were reported at the 2008 ASCO annual meeting (data from final analysis not available for inclusion in Table 1 ) [ 21 ]
2686726:Undoubtedly, the future of oncology lies in individualized treatment based on each person's genetic composition
2686726:The trial enrolled 110 patients with metastatic CRC who had received at least one prior therapy
2686726:Obviously, other markers or combinations of markers that better predict response to a chosen treatment are urgently needed
2686726:All authors read and approved the final manuscript
2686726:In other words, the majority of people receiving cetuximab may not benefit from it, while incurring all the associated cost and toxicities
2686726:The fourth study compared an every-2-week schedule of cetuximab with the approved weekly regimen [ 23 ]
2686726:In breast cancer, data have shown that genetic profiling may predict which patients benefit from adjuvant therapy after resection of their breast cancers
2686726:In this article, we will discuss targeted therapies for CRC based on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and review published data about the potential usefulness of the downstream oncogene Kirsten ras (KRAS) as a biological marker for response to these therapies
2686726:Across all of the treatment arms shown in the 4 studies in Table 2 , a median of 40% of patients (range 33% � 46%) had KRAS MT tumors
2686726:The identification of specific subgroups of patients who may benefit from a particular targeted therapy has been most successful in patients with breast cancer
2686726:KRAS encodes a membrane-associated GTPase that is an early player in many signal transduction pathways
2686726:Table 1 summarizes the results of 12 studies in which previously treated patients with metastatic CRC received treatment with cetuximab alone or cetuximab as part of a multi-drug regimen (in combination with either irinotecan or oxaliplatin) [ 7 - 18 ]
2686726:The aforementioned studies demonstrated the predictive value of KRAS for outcomes of EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic CRC who had received previous chemotherapy
2686726:For patients on Arm A, who received the standard dose of cetuximab, response rates were 21.1% and 0% for wild-type KRAS and mutant KRAS, respectively
2686726:The investigators then screened the tumors without detectable KRAS mutations, using two sensitive methods able to specifically detect KRAS exon 2 mutations: a multiplex SNaPshot assay based on primer extension able to detect the different KRAS mutations simultaneously in a single tube, and a fluorescent PCR-LCR assay
2686726:When an activating mutation occurs in the KRAS gene, the RAS G-protein activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade downstream of EGFR
2686726:Markers currently under study include EGFR copy number, EGFR ligands, microsatellite instability (MSI), PTEN, PI3K, and others
2686726:How to use available agents to maximize the benefit and minimize the associated cost and toxicity is a critical question
2686726:Data retrieved included KRAS status (wild type [WT] or mutant type [MT]) and outcome (objective response rate [RR; complete response + partial response], time to progression [TTP], and overall survival [OS])
2686726:Because of their differing isotypes, it is possible that these two antibodies may differ in their mechanism of action, but this has not been documented
2686726:Trastuzumab, a HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody, is most beneficial in patients with tumors that overexpress HER2
2686726:[ 15 ] determined the KRAS mutation status and mRNA expression levels of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and epiregulin in 95 patients with primary CRC treated with cetuximab and irinotecan and correlated these variables with response and overall survival
2686726:Developing and validating more sensitive, reproducible, and affordable KRAS tests that can be used in the clinic is an important task that industry and government should undertake in order to maximize the value of this biomarker for individualized therapies in CRC
2686726:The recent analysis of the KRAS data from the EVEREST study shed some light on this question [ 17 ]
2686726:The authors declare that they have no competing interests
2686726:These six additional mutations were found in two patients with stable disease and four patients with disease progression
2686726:For patients with KRAS WT tumors compared with KRAS MT tumors, the median RRs to cetuximab-containing treatment regimens (4 study arms reporting) were 58% (range 28% � 61%) and 33% (range 0% � 36%), respectively, and the median TTP values (4 study arms reporting) were 9.7 months (range 7.7 months � 10.5 months) and 6.6 months (range 5.5 months � 8.6 months), respectively
2686726:In this study, patients with grade 0/1 skin reactions after 22 days of treatment with irinotecan and standard-dose cetuximab were randomized to receive a standard dose (250 mg/m2) (Arm A) or escalated doses (up to 500 mg/m2) (Arm B) of cetuximab
2686726:Recently, Kirsten ras (KRAS) status has emerged as a predictor of response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapies
2686726:Cetuximab is a recombinant, chimeric, IgG1 monoclonal antibody, while panitumumab is a fully humanized IgG2 antibody
2686726:Using direct sequencing of DNA extracted from tumor samples, the investigators detected a KRAS mutation in 16 out of 59 (27%) patients
2686726:The ability of skin reaction to distinguish subgroups of KRAS WT or MT patients with differing outcomes argues that skin reaction and KRAS status are independent predictors of response to cetuximab-based treatment
2686726:Individualized therapies that are tailored to a patient's genetic composition will be of tremendous value for treatment of cancer
2686726:In summary, all studies discussed above using cetuximab either as a monotherapy or in combination with either irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for previously treated metastatic CRC patients showed that KRAS mutational status clearly predicts unresponsiveness to cetuximab
2686726:This phase II, open-label, single-arm trial was designed to prospectively estimate the efficacy of panitumumab plus FOLFIRI treatment as a function of tumor KRAS status in patients undergoing second-line treatment for metastatic CRC
2686726:In the CARO2 study which compared CapOxBev with and without cetuximab, patients whose tumor has MT type KRAS did worse which did reach statistical significance [ 24 ]
2686726:(Table 2 ) [ 22 - 25 ] Three of these studies, presenting results from the phase III CRYSTAL and CAIRO2 trials and the phase II OPUS trial, compared outcomes in patients treated with standard chemotherapy regimens (FOLFIRI, CapOxBev, FOLFOX) with or without the addition of cetuximab [ 22 , 24 , 25 ]
2686726:Several commercial DNA sequencing-based KRAS tests for tumor tissues are available
2686726:Many of these patients will receive one or more lines of chemotherapy, but not everyone responds to each regimen
2686726:In addition, given the clear predictive value of KRAS status, all future trials involving EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies should incorporate KRAS testing
2686726:In the two largest studies [ 19 , 20 ], no patients with KRAS MT tumors showed an objective tumor response to panitumumab
2686726:This study, initially designed to enroll 2289 patients, has already accrued about 1400 patients
2686726:Both cetuximab and panitumumab have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with chemo-refractory metastatic CRC compared with best supportive care [ 4 , 5 ]
2686726:Cetuximab has been demonstrated to improve response rate, time to progression, and overall survival when added to irinotecan for patients with irinotecan-refractory metastatic CRC [ 2 ]
2686726:Data reported from the interim analysis supported previous studies showing that patients with KRAS MT tumors do not respond to panitumumab therapy
2686726:HRAS is subsequently released from the GEF and quickly re-binds to the now available GTP resulting in HRAS activation
2686726:These two analyses were performed on samples from 11 out of 12 patients with either complete response or partial response, in 15 out of 16 patients with stable disease, and in 15 patients with disease progression, all of whom had no mutations revealed by direct sequencing of tumor DNA
2686726:In the report from Amado and colleagues [ 19 ], patient outcomes with panitumumab treatment were compared with outcomes in a matched population of patients who received best supportive care only
2686726:There is strong evidence that mutated KRAS in tumors predicts unresponsiveness to EGFR-targeted antibody therapies
2686726:Skin reaction predicted clinical outcomes in patients with both KRAS WT and KRAS MT tumors, with a grade 2/3 reaction associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with a grade 1/2 reaction in each group
2686726:Authors wish to thank Lorraine Cherry for her editorial help in the preparation of this manuscript.
2686726:A total of 110 patients with metastatic CRC with progression after first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were enrolled in this study
2686726:Two monoclonal antibodies that target EGFR have clinical activity against CRC: cetuximab and panitumumab
2686726:They found that both KRAS and the EGF-A16G polymorphism significantly predicted response to cetuximab-containing treatment combinations, regardless of the specific regimen selected
2686726:As EGFR monoclonal antibody-targeted therapies are being taken away, these patients are left with only two lines of therapy, either FOLFOX or FOLIRI along with bevacizumab
2686726:In this article, we will discuss targeted therapies for colorectal cancers (CRC) based on EGFR signaling pathway and review published data about the potential usefulness of KRAS as a biological marker for response to these therapies
2686726:This may bypass the need for ligand binding to EGFR, conferring resistance to therapies like cetuximab or panitumumab which target the EGFR extracellularly
2686726:Transcriptional profiling was conducted on RNA from mandatory pretreatment metastatic biopsies to identify genes whose expression correlated with best clinical responses
2686726:For patients on Arm B, who received escalated doses of cetuximab, the response rates for patients with wild-type KRAS and mutant KRAS were 46.4% and 0%, respectively
2686726:Targeted therapy, which has been the hot topic for the past decade, now plays a key role in the treatment of CRCs
2686726:When activated, KRAS is involved in the dephosphorylation of GTP to GDP, after which it is turned off
2686726:Does the predictive value of KRAS also apply to chemotherapy-na�ve patients? At the 2008 ASCO annual meeting, at least four studies confirmed that it does
2686726:However, the overall range of PFS values was significantly higher in the KRAS WT group; at 200 days, the average PFS associated with a Grade 2/3 reaction was 60% in the wild-type KRAS group compared with approximately 34% in the mutant KRAS group
2686726:This mechanistic, target-based approach is adding to the treatment options for cancer, and these treatments should be less toxic to normal cells and thus improve the therapeutic index
2686726:These studies reflected response to EGFR-targeted therapies in patients with metastatic CRC as a function of KRAS status, and were divided into three groups: (1) previously treated patients who received cetuximab therapy; (2) previously treated patients who received panitumumab therapy; and (3) chemotherapy-na�ve patients who received cetuximab therapy
2686726:It is therefore important to test KRAS status in tumors of all patients being considered for EGFR-targeted antibody therapies, and only those patients with KRAS WT tumors should receive such treatments
2686726:need to be modified
2686726:Considering the large number of cases of CRC, this translates into millions of dollars spent and significant toxicities experienced with no benefit
2686726:No KRAS mutation was found in the 12 patients with a complete or partial tumor response
2686726:Descriptive statistics were used to compare outcomes in the three treatment groups as a function of KRAS status
2686726:These studies reflected response (or lack of response) to EGFR-targeted therapies in patients with metastatic CRC as a function of KRAS status
2686726:The difference in targeted therapy effectiveness in CML compared with solid tumors can be explained in part by the genetic etiology of the diseases
2686726:They can block ligand binding to the receptor, aborting the process of dimerization and phosphorylation that allows downstream signal transduction
2686726:OS was reported in 6 studies, with median values of 11.5 months (range 9.5 months � 16.3 months) compared with 6.9 months (range 4.2 months � 10.1 months) associated with KRAS WT and KRAS MT, respectively
2686726:Over the past decade, we have witnessed an important development in the field of cancer treatment: therapy that is targeted to specific pathways involved in tumor growth and progression
2686726:To determine whether dose escalation was also able to induce response in patients with mutated KRAS, the authors analyzed KRAS mutation status using archived tissue from 77 of 89 randomized patients
2686726:In summary, as with cetuximab, all available studies (with the exception of the very small data set reported by Moroni et al
2686726:It should now become a standard practice that any patients being considered for EGFR targeted therapies have their tumors tested for KRAS status and only those with wild-type KRAS being offered such therapies
2686726:These gene mutations, principally in codons 12 and 13, occur in up to one-half of CRCs, and population-based studies have suggested that the mutations might be associated with some tumor phenotypes [ 6 ]
2686726:EGFR binds soluble ligands, including epidermal growth factors (EGFs) and transforming growth factor-alpha, and the ligand/receptor complex then signals the formation of receptor dimers (either homodimers or heterodimers with other members of the HER family)
2686726:In each case, KRAS MT was also associated with reduced TTP and OS
2686726:10%, respectively)
2686726:However, when more potent agents of this type are developed, they will need to be determined whether their efficacy is influenced by the presence of KRAS mutations in the tumor
2686726:Five additional KRAS mutations were detected by both methods and one mutation was detected only by PCR-LCR assay
2686726:Recent developments in individualized therapies for CRC are having a significant impact on current clinical practice and on the future development of treatments for this disease
2686726:While data clearly indicate that KRAS MT predicts unresponsiveness to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody therapies, KRAS WT does not necessarily predict response: the median response rate of wild-type KRAS tumors in the studies reviewed here was only 35%
2686726:These findings show great promise for identifying patients eligible for treatment with specific targeted therapies, as well as for making decisions about dosage and length of treatment
2686726:Patients received panitumumab and FOLFIRI every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerability
2686726:Furthermore, data from the CRYSTAL, OPUS, and CAIRO2 studies showed evidence that the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy (both oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based) may have detrimental effects on patients with KRAS MT tumors
2686726:In the 10 studies that reported objective tumor response to cetuximab-containing therapy, the median RR in patients with KRAS WT tumors was 35% (range 12% � 42%) compared with 0% (range 0% � 6%) in patients with KRAS MT tumors
2686726:It is likely that verification of KRAS wild-type status will be required by the United States Food and Drug Administrative (US FDA) for cetuximab and panitumumab treatment in the near future
2686726:CML is caused by a single genetic alteration that results in a BCR/ABL fusion gene
2686726:At present, small molecule inhibitors have not shown significant benefit in CRCs
2686726:KRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch for the recruitment and activation of proteins necessary for the propagation of growth factor and other receptor signals, such as c-Raf and PI 3-kinase
2686726:Future trials with novel biologically rational agents should be developed for these patients
2686726:Dimerization triggers an intracellular phosphorylation cascade that transmits the original ligand-generated signal from the cell surface to the nucleus, causing downstream changes in gene expression that affect cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis
2686726:With more convincing KRAS data, it undoubtedly requires modification
2686726:This gene produces a chimeric protein with strong tyrosine kinase activity that can be effectively blocked by Gleevec
2686726:The CALGB/SWOG 80405 study compares bevacizumab and cetuximab either alone or together in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX chemotherapy in patients with untreated metastatic CRC
2686726:The emerging KRAS data leaves open the question of what to do for patients with KRAS mutant tumors
2686726:Of these 16 patients, 13 had a progression of disease and three had stable disease
2686726:The data reported by Benvenuti and colleagues [ 9 ] showed a two-fold increase in RR associated with KRAS WT status compared with KRAS MT status (20% vs
2686726:Although patients originally selected for randomization had a 0/1 skin reaction after 22 days of standard treatment, with continued treatment some patients developed a more severe cutaneous response to the medication
2686726:This may not apply to small molecule inhibitors that specifically target the intracellular downstream protein kinases
2686726:Thus, not only does cetuximab appear to have no benefit in patients with KRAS MT tumors, it may have a negative effect on outcome, particularly in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy in first line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
2686726:Efficacy endpoints included objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival by KRAS status
2686726:The outcomes in 4 studies in which previously treated patients with metastatic CRC received treatment with panitumumab as monotherapy are similar to those reported above for cetuximab (Table 1 )
2686726:Therefore, tumors with KRAS mutations that confer constitutive activation of intracellular downstream pathways may not respond to these monoclonal antibody-targeted therapies
2686726:It is quite possible that certain genetic signatures will predict response (or lack of response) to certain regimens for CRC
2686726:[ 7 ] with panitumumab as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for previously treated metastatic CRC patients show that KRAS mutation status clearly predicts response to panitumumab
2686726:A second study, the iBET trial, which was developed based on the BRiTE data, tests whether continuing bevacizumab beyond progression on first line therapy would be beneficial
2361658:Further, inhibitory SMADs have been shown to be upregulated in coordination with k-ras mutation in epithelial cancer ( Liu et al , 2003 )
2361658:Demographic and epidemiologic data, including all of the data on tobacco use and occupational asbestos exposure, were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire completed by patients and subsequently reviewed by a single reviewer during the hospitalisation for thoracic surgery
2361658:The relationship between the TGF ? /BMP antigrowth and Ras/MAP-K progrowth signalling pathways remains unclear, but there is recent evidence of crosstalk between them ( Kretzschmar et al , 1997 ; Yue et al , 1999 ; Wach et al , 2001 )
2361658:Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit
2361658:Following treatment with 5-aza-deoxycytadine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, transcription was reactivated, demonstrating that the loss of transcription of BMP6 is due to epigenetic inactivation ( Figure 1B )
2361658:Direct experimental investigation of this interaction in human cells and a description of the effects of different carcinogens in different tissues upon the disruption of this signalling are clearly indicated
2361658:k-ras mutation, which leads to aberrant Ras/MAP-K pro-growth signalling, has been well studied in cancer ( Cunningham and Weinberg, 1985 ; Nelson et al , 1999 ; Huber and Stratakis, 2004 )
2361658:The primers used are as follows: (M) 5?-GGT TTG TTG GGT AGT CGG G-3? (sense) and GCC CCT CCC CAA ATC G-3? (antisense) and (U) 5?-TTG GGT AGT TGG GTG ATT GTT-3? (sense) and 5?-ACA CCC CTC CCC AAA TCA-3? (antisense)
2361658:We evaluated BMP3b and BMP6 gene promoter methylation status in 155 NSCLC cases
2361658:In a consecutive case series, we found that 57% (88 out of 155) and 43% (67 out of 155) of NSCLCs were methylated at the BMP3b and BMP6 gene promoters, respectively
2361658:Our data, showing that epigenetic inactivation of BMP3b (at a frequency similar to that previously reported ( Dai et al , 2004 )) and BMP6 tend to occur together in lung cancer, suggests that in NSCLC multiple BMPs may need to be silenced in order to abrogate their antigrowth signalling
2361658:We found that 52% (46/88) of the cases with BMP3b methylation were also positive for BMP6 methylation; 31% (21/67) of cases without BMP3b methylation were positive for BMP6 methylation
2361658:BMP6 mRNA was absent in WTK1 normal human lymphoblastoid cells
2361658:The BMPs transduce their signals directly through the SMAD family of proteins but they also have been reported to interact with the MAPK and Erk pathways
2361658:Recent work has shown that BMP3b is epigenetically inactivated in cancer and suggests that BMP6 can be epigenetically inactivated
2361658:Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are an integral component of the TGF ? superfamily, responsible for regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and programmed cell death in a variety of cell types
2361658:Asbestos exposure has been associated with cytogenetic damage in humans ( Dusinska et al , 2004 )
2361658:The balance between antigrowth and progrowth signalling that is imperative for normal cell development and homeostasis is reliant upon multiple feedback signalling pathways
2361658:We next investigated the relationship between BMP epigenetic inactivation and k-ras mutation
2361658:Nontreated and Sss I methylase-treated lymphocytes were used as controls
2361658:Tumours were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ?80�C until genomic preparation
2361658:The finding that asbestos exposure is associated with a significantly different pattern of signalling dysregulation in NSCLC supports the notion that clonal selection has important nodal points that are influenced by the pattern of carcinogen exposure
2361658:The WTK1 and HT cell lines did not express BMP6
2361658:Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher's exact test (or ? 2 test) were used for continuous and categorical variables in univariate analysis, respectively
2361658:( B ) WTK1 cells were treated with 1? ? l 5-aza-deoxycytadine in PBS or PBS alone for 3 days and then harvested
2361658:cDNA was amplified using an annealing temperature of 60�C over 35 cycles
2361658:SAS software was used for statistical analysis
2361658:In the case of BMP inactivation, there was no apparent association of methylation silencing with tobacco exposure
2361658:Some evidence suggests that Ras inactivates SMAD signalling while other evidence suggests that Ras activates SMAD signalling ( Kretzschmar et al , 1997 ; Yue et al , 1999 )
2361658:Although the exact relationship between BMPs and Ras in signalling are unclear, our data are consistent with the mounting evidence that the relationship is important in solid tumours
2361658:While there is experimental evidence of an association between the BMP signalling proteins and oncogenic Ras, the nature of any interaction of BMP cytokine inactivation and k-ras mutation has been relatively unexplored in human tumours
2361658:Eligible cases consisted of all the newly diagnosed patients with resectable lung cancer who received treatment at the Massachusetts General Hospital Thoracic Surgery Service from November 1992 to December 1996 ( Nelson et al , 1999 )
2361658:Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to estimate the relationship between methylation of BMPs, k-ras mutation and covariates that were statistically significant in univariate analysis and that were important biologically
2361658:Our data show that the BMP pathway, which is antiproliferative, is selected for inactivation preferentially in k-ras mutant tumours in NSCLC, likely as a direct means of potentiating progrowth signalling
2361658:Those with BMP6 methylation were more likely to have k-ras mutation, but this was not statistically significant
2361658:There was no statistically significant relationship between BMP methylation and tobacco exposure ( Table 2 )
2361658:Patients with recurrent disease or nonoperable tumours were excluded
2361658:Inactivation of the BMP pathway genes has been implicated as important in several cancers
2361658:Hence, asbestos may be selecting for pathway inactivation via large-scale genetic changes
2361658:Asbestos exposure was defined as having any occupational asbestos exposure (yes/no), assessed as previously described ( Nelson et al , 1999 )
2361658:The PCR mixture contained 10 � PCR buffer, dNTPs (200? ? M of each), primers (1? ? M of each) and 0.25? ? l TaqGold
2361658:However, concurrent methylation of both BMP3b and BMP6 was strongly associated with k-ras mutation ( Table 1 , P <0.003)
2361658:BMP6 is re-expressed in the WTK1 cells
2361658:The current work suggests that the Ras and BMP pathways are part of a complex network of inter-related and interacting signalling proteins where multiple factors, including carcinogen exposure, determine the precise character of somatic genes inactivated in this particular tumour, NSCLC
2361658:If asbestos were associated with induction of SMAD4 inactivation in lung cancer, one would expect the inverse association with BMP silencing that we have observed
2361658:Approximately 50?ng of DNA was used as template
2361658:This work was supported by CA100679, CA078609 and ES00002
2361658:There were 155 cases with fresh tumour DNA available to be tested for BMP3b and BMP6 methylation
2361658:Prostate carcinoma DU145 cells and lung fibroblast IMR90 cells were maintained in minimum essential media (Eagle's) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
2361658:In the subset of cases with both k-ras and BMP data, 16% (24/147) were mutated at codon 12 of the k-ras gene and BMP3b methylation was significantly associated with k-ras mutation ( Table 1 , P <0.03)
2361658:Furthermore, this coinactivation of BMP3b and BMP6 is significantly associated with mutation of k-ras codon 12 in lung cancer ( P =0.003); those with a k-ras mutation were six times more likely to have concurrent methylation of these BMP loci
2361658:A logistic regression analysis, controlling for histology and gender showed that tumours with k-ras mutation are six-fold more likely to have concurrent BMP3/6 silencing (OR=6.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) =2.0�17.9) and asbestos exposure significantly decreased the likelihood of concurrent BMP3/6 methylation (OR=0.2, CI 0.1�0.9; Table 2 )
2361658:B-actin cDNA was amplified using primers supplied with the SuperScript III kit
2361658:Product was amplified using an annealing temperature of 60�C over 38 cycles
2361658:We also studied the relationship between BMP methylation and k-ras mutation
2361658:PCR products were separated by electrophoresis and visualised by ethidium bromide staining
2361658:This will more precisely define the aetiologic effects of carcinogens (such as asbestos), delineate the interlocking pathways that are dysregulated in solid tumours, and potentially open avenues for prevention and treatment of these often-fatal cancers
2361658:Lymphoblastic WTK1 and HT cells, small-cell carcinoma Shp77 cells, and non-small-cell carcinoma H322M and A549 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
2361658:There are multiple BMPs with overlapping substrate specificity ( Stott et al , 1998 )
2361658:Therefore, we examined the relationship between tobacco use, asbestos exposure and k-ras mutation, and epigenetic silencing of the BMPs ( Table 2 )
2361658:( A ) BMP6 cDNA was amplified using an annealing temperature of 60�C over 35 cycles with the following primers: 5?-ACA GCA TAA CAT GGG GCT TC-3? (sense) and 5?-CTC GGG GTT CAT AAG GTG AA-3? (antisense)
2361658:The BMPs are well recognised to play multiple crucial roles in the development of diverse tissues
2361658:Approximately 50?ng of sodium bisuphfite-modified DNA was used as template
2361658:Hence, these data suggest that concurrent inactivation of the BMP and activation of the Ras signalling pathways are important in lung carcinogenesis
2361658:It is well recognised that the BMP signalling pathways are crucial for all stages of embryonic development, including regulation of lung development and airway branching ( Weaver et al , 1999 ; Lu et al , 2001 ; Rosendahl et al , 2002 )
2361658:For example, SMAD4, the effector protein in the BMP pathway, has been identified as mutated and deleted in lung cancer ( Nagatake et al , 1996 ; An et al , 2002 )
2361658:We previously have reported the k-ras mutation status of these cases ( Nelson et al , 1999 )
2361658:Here, we demonstrate that the BMP3b and BMP6 genes are common targets of epigenetic inactivation in NSCLC, and that they are significantly more likely to be concurrently inactivated ( P =0.009)
2361658:In addition, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (a condition associated with asbestos exposure) is associated with activation of the BMP/SMAD signalling pathway ( Matsuse et al , 1996 ; Rosendahl et al , 2002 )
2361658:BMP6 is epigenetically inactivated in cancer cell lines
2361658:They act through upregulation of the cell cycle proteins p21 and p27 ( Nakamura et al , 2003 ; Brubaker et al , 2004 ; Haudenschild et al , 2004 )
2361658:The BMP6 primers used are as follows: 5?-ACA GCA TAA CAT GGG GCT TC-3? (sense) and 5?-CTC GGG GTT CAT AAG GTG AA-3?
2361658:We investigated whether BMP6 is epigenetically inactivated in cell lines and whether BMP3b and BMP6 are epigenetically inactivated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
2361658:k-ras mutation has previously been associated with asbestos exposure in these patients ( Nelson et al , 1999 )
2361658:( C ) The BMP6 gene promoter methylation status was determined by amplifying bisulphite-modified DNA using primers specific to methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) DNA
2361658:The DNA was amplified using an annealing temperature of 60�C over 38 cycles with the following primers: (M) 5?-GGT TTG TTG GGT AGT CGG G-3? (sense) and GCC CCT CCC CAA ATC G-3? (antisense) and (U) 5?-TTG GGT AGT TGG GTG ATT GTT-3? (sense) and 5?-ACA CCC CTC CCC AAA TCA-3? (antisense).
2361658:The BMPs have been shown to be growth inhibitory by suppressing proliferation ( Dai et al , 2004 ; Haudenschild et al , 2004 )
2361658:In an effort to determine whether transcription of the BMP6 gene is inhibited by promoter methylation, we first examined the transcriptional status of BMP6 in cell lines using RT�PCR ( Figure 1A )
2361658:However, we identified an inverse relationship between asbestos exposure and BMP methylation
2361658:SMAD7, one of the inhibitory SMADs of the BMP/TGF ? signalling pathway, has been shown to cooperate with oncogenic Ras to escape growth arrest ( Liu et al , 2003 )
2361658:k-ras mutation has been described as a relatively early event in cancer ( Nelson et al , 1999 ) that constitutively activates the protein leading to active growth signalling
2361658:WTK1 cells (2 � 105) in 10?ml media were treated with 1? ? l 5-aza-deoxycytadine in PBS or PBS alone for 3 days and then harvested
2361658:Using primers designed specifically to differentiate between methylated and nonmethylated DNA at the BMP6 gene promoter, we demonstrated that the WTK1 cells are methylated at the BMP6 gene promoter ( Figure 1C )
2361658:Two sets of primers specific to the BMP6 promoter region were designed using Primer3 to amplify bisulphite-modified DNA; one specific for DNA methylated (M) at the promoter region and the other specific for unmethylated (U) DNA
2361658:While BMP-2 stimulation of osteoblasts leads to activation of Ras ( Nakayama et al , 2003 ), in Xenopus , BMP-4-stimulated erythroid differentiation is inhibited by dominant-negative activation of the Ras pathway ( Xu et al , 1996 )
2361658:However, additional signalling pathways are acknowledged to play important roles in malignant disease, with the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway emerging as important in multiple cancers ( Nagatake et al , 1996 ; Tamada et al , 2001 ; Baldus et al , 2004 ; Dai et al , 2004 ; Kim et al , 2004 )
2361658:They are also believed to play a role in the genesis of many tumour types, with their inactivation allowing for dysregulated cellular proliferation
2361658:Since both BMP3b and BMP6 signal in the same pathways, we tested whether there was a relationship between inactivation of the two genes
2361658:Reverse transcription PCR (RT�PCR) amplification of the BMP6 cDNA was performed using primers designed with Primer3
2361658:cDNA was synthesised from the RNA using the SuperScript III kit from Invitrogen
2361658:All patients involved provided written informed consent in accordance with the appropriate institutional review boards
2361658:This statistically significant association between concurrent methylation of BMP3b and BMP6 ( P =0.009) indicates that the epigenetic silencing of these genes does not occur independently in lung cancer
2361658:Increasing evidence shows that there is a crosstalk between TGF ? /BMP antigrowth signalling and Ras/MAP-K progrowth signalling, and it is likely that the interaction of these pathways is cell type and tissue specific
2361658:As a result of the known importance of BMP signalling in the respiratory tract and the in vitro evidence of crosstalk between signalling pathways, we hypothesised that concurrent BMP inactivation and oncogenic k-ras mutation would be important in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
2361658:PCR product was visualised on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel
2607229:Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) expression was identified in 18 (38.2%) out of 45 ovarian carcinomas
2607229:One week after tumour-cell injection, either CI-1040 (CI-1040, 150?mg?kg?1, resuspended in 10% Cremophore EL (Sigma), 10% ethanol, and 80% water) or a vehicle only (10% Cremophore EL (Sigma), 10% ethanol, and 80% water) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) once daily for 3 weeks
2607229:The total tumour weight at that time was around 500?mg
2607229:Only four of these cell lines, MDAH2774, ES2, MPSC1, and POC1, strongly expressed p-ERK1/2
2607229:The mutational status of KRAS and BRAF for each sample is shown under the cell lines and primary cancer cell cultures
2607229:Positive active p-ERK1/2 was identified in 27 (46.6%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas
2607229:The patients were stratified into two groups depending on the mutational status of KRAS/BRAF 
2607229:Necropsy was carried out on all mice to assess i.p
2607229:The findings in this study provide new insight into the biological roles of the RAS�RAF�MEK�ERK signalling pathway in ovarian carcinomas
2607229:In addition, human papillomavirus E6/E7-immortalised primary cultures of normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) were also included in this study
2607229:Western blot analysis was performed on ovarian cancer/OSE cell lines/cultures, including OVCAR3, SKOV3, A2780, MDAH2774, ES2, MPSC1, KF28, OVK#18, OMC3, JHOC5, PC1, PC2, PC3, IOSE29, OSE7, and OSE10
2607229:Expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) is undetectable in all CI-1040-treated samples
2607229:Freshly isolated tumour cells were allowed to grow in culture and were used for experiments within two passages
2607229:This suggests an epistatic relationship in which either mutation is sufficient to deregulate a common effector pathway, such as the MAP kinase kinase (MEK)�ERK kinase cascade
2607229:However, its favourable therapeutic index and high selectivity may outweigh its shortcomings in KRAS and BRAF mutant ovarian cancer
2607229:Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on British Journal of Cancer website ( http://www.nature.com/bjc ) Chromatograms of KRAS and BRAF mutational status in three representative ovarian cancer cells
2607229:OSE7 and OSE10 normal OSE cell lines were a kind gift from Dr Hidetaka Katabuchi (Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan)
2607229:This is in contrast with a recent report showing that this pathway is frequently activated independent of the status of KRAS and BRAF in endometrioid-type endometrial cancer ( Mizumoto et al , 2007 )
2607229:Ovarian cancers with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF are more sensitive to growth inhibition by CI-1040 than those with wild-type (WT) sequences
2607229:In addition, this observation further supports the theory that ovarian carcinoma arises from multiple pathways ( Shih Ie and Kurman, 2004 , 2005 )
2607229:However, the diluent control-treated cells grew much larger i.p
2607229:This may reflect a more indolent course of tumours with KRAS/BRAF mutations
2607229:Tumour xenografts from both MDAH2774 ( KRAS mutant) and SKOV3 (wild type of KRAS and BRAF ) cell lines were established in a nu / nu mouse model
2607229:After filtration through sieve membranes (with 100? ? m pores), tumour cells were immunosorted using an epithelial specific antigen (Ep-CAM) antibody bound to Dynal� beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) following the vendor's instructions ( Nakayama et al , 2006 )
2607229:Both of these codons are mutation hot spots
2607229:Genomic DNA was purified from all the cell lines and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using a Qiaquick polymerase chain reaction (PCR) purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)
2607229:Tumours were excised and weighed
2607229:The data are expressed as the total tumour weight from each mouse
2607229:Somatic mutations of KRAS were identified in 8 (13.7%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas
2607229:On the basis of the above findings, we investigated whether CI-1040 had a growth-inhibitory effect on tumour formation and development in vivo 
2607229:Next, we examined the prognostic effect of KRAS/BRAF mutations and p-ERK1/2 expression
2607229:This study is supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan, and the Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology
2607229:CI-1040 had no significant effect on the growth of normal cells, including the OSE cells
2607229:All the patients were primarily treated with cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant platinum and taxane chemotherapy (CBDCA AUC5, Paclitaxel 175?mg?m?2 or Docetaxel 70?mg?m?2)
2607229:Overall survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up
2607229:Our results provide compelling evidence that the biological effects of the ERK signalling pathway depend on the mutational status of its upstream regulators, (i.e.), the KRAS and BRAF genes
2607229:Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) uptake and staining were measured using a cell proliferation kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England, UK) and apoptotic cells were detected using an Annexin V staining kit (Bio Vision, Mountain View, CA, USA)
2607229:This difference may be because of a higher percentage of early-stage ovarian cancers and endometrioid and mucinous histology tumours being included in this study as compared with the earlier study
2607229:In summary, we have shown that the phenotypic change in ovarian carcinomas in response to ERK1/2 inactivation depends on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF 
2607229:No significant correlations between KRAS/BRAF mutations or p-ERK1/2 expression and overall survival were found in patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with platinum and taxane chemotherapy ( P =0.2460, P =0.9339, respectively)
2607229:These samples were obtained from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Shimane University Hospital
2607229:This difference in sensitivity to the RAS�RAF�MEK�ERK pathway between ovarian cancer and the latter types is intriguing, and it probably reflects organ-specific roles of the KRAS and BRAF oncogenes
2607229:However, we did not find a significant correlation between p-ERK expression and overall survival in our study
2607229:This is consistent with an earlier report ( Mizumoto et al , 2007 )
2607229:There was no significant relationship between KRAS/BRAF mutations or p-ERK1/2 expression and overall survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma ( P =0.2460, P =0.9339, respectively)
2607229:D, DMSO treatment, C, and CI-1040 treatment
2607229:The antibody used in this study was a rabbit polyclonal antibody that reacted with phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology)
2607229:tumour growth, and the tumours were excised and weighed
2607229:( B ) Apoptotic cells are quantified by counting them under a fluorescent microscope
2607229:It is likely that KRAS/BRAF mutation is not the only determinant for activating ERK1/2
2607229:The experiment was performed 72?h after CI-1040 or DMSO treatment
2607229:Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the regulations of the Institutional Ethical Commission (Shimane University) and of the United Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research guidelines (Workman, 1998 )
2607229:In an earlier report, advanced ovarian cancer patients (stage III, IV) with p-ERK expression had a longer overall survival than patients with low p-ERK values ( Hsu et al , 2004 )
2607229:Exon 1 of KRAS and exon 15 of BRAF were both sequenced, as these mutational hot spots together harbour nearly all published mutations ( Davies et al , 2002 ; Singer et al , 2002 , 2003 ; Sieben et al , 2004 )
2607229:The relationships between KRAS/BRAF mutations and clinicopathological factors, including p-ERK1/2 expression are shown in Table 2 
2607229:The total dose of CI-1040 for each mouse was 63?mg
2607229:All the cases received 6�12 courses of this regimen
2607229:( D ) Immunoreactivity is absent in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in CI-1040-untreated tumour cells.
2607229:Several genetic alterations are associated with ovarian carcinogenesis
2607229:In this study, we carried out a genotype�phenotype correlation of ovarian cancer cells using a MEK inhibitor, CI-1040
2607229:The diagnoses were confirmed by a surgical pathologist before the tumour samples were harvested for experiments
2607229:( B ) p-ERK1/2 expression does not correlate with shorter overall survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma
2607229:The mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in all 45 ovarian carcinomas is summarised in Table 1 
2607229:The primers for PCR and sequencing were manufactured by GeneLink (Hawthorne, NY, USA), and their sequences were described in an earlier report ( Nakayama et al , 2006 )
2607229:Mutations of either BRAF or KRA S lead to constitutive activation (phosphorylation) of their downstream target, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), also known as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) ( Olson and Hallahan, 2004 ; Wan et al , 2004 )
2607229:In these cases, combined treatment with surgery and chemotherapy is necessary
2607229:Data were censored when patients were lost to follow-up
2607229:In more than 70% of patients with ovarian carcinoma, there is evidence of tumour dissemination beyond the ovaries at diagnosis
2607229:The results in Table 2 show that KRAS/BRAF mutation is correlated significantly with FIGO stage I, II ( P <0.001), and p-ERK1/2 ( P <0.001)
2607229:( C and D ) Immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in tumours with KRAS mutant MDAH2774 cells
2607229:( B ) In contrast, there were no differences in tumour weights between CI-1040-treated cells and control-treated cells in wild-type (WT) KRAS/BRAF SKOV3 cells
2607229:The paraffin tissue blocks were organised into tissue microarrays, which were made by removing 3?mm diameter cores of tumour from each block
2607229:During the study, the mice were killed when it was discovered that the abdomen of one of the mice had begun to distend because of ascites
2607229:A panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cultures was first analysed for tumour mutation status in the KRAS and BRAF genes
2607229:The sequences were analysed using the Lasergene programme, DNASTAR (Madison, WI, USA)
2607229:Thus, inactivation of ERK1/2 results in marked growth inhibition in ovarian carcinomas with mutations in KRAS or BRAF in comparison with only a modest effect on wild-type tumours
2607229:In this study, we focussed on CI-1040 because it inhibited the common downstream target in the RAS signalling pathway
2607229:This was evident in both in vitro and in vivo studies
2607229:Although the functions of the RAS�RAF�MEK�ERK pathway and its downstream effectors have been recently explored, only the serous type of ovarian cancer has been studied ( Hsu et al , 2004 ; Pohl et al , 2005 )
2607229:Western blot analysis
2607229:Detection of apoptotic cells and proliferation cells
2607229:The percentage of positive cells was estimated by randomly counting ?500 tumour cells from three different high-power fields (� 40) within one specimen
2607229:First-line chemotherapy with platinum drugs and taxanes yields a response rate of over 80%, but almost all patients relapse
2607229:Similarly, alternative pathways for ERK activation, such as crosstalk with the PI3K pathway, exist in endometrial cancer but are rare in ovarian cancer
2607229:The membranes were probed with an active ERK1/2 antibody (pTEpY, 1?:?5000) (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1?:?20?000)
2607229:In this study, KRAS / BRAF mutations tended to have a favourable but not statistically significant effect on overall survival
2607229:Four weeks after the cell injection (three weeks after CI-1040 injection), the abdomens of the control group mice had begun to distend
2607229:A panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cultures of ovarian cancer were first analysed for KRAS and BRAF gene mutation status
2607229:Tumours that start causing ascites have a chance of developing other malignant characteristics, which can become harmful progressively
2607229:( C ) Treatment with CI-1040 decreases DNA synthesis as measured by BrdUrd uptake in ES2 cells, but not KF28 cells
2607229:Drugs of this type would be particularly useful for recurrent disease that has acquired chemoresistance
2607229:KRAS/BRAF mutation was significantly correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, II ( P <0.001), and p-ERK1/2 ( P <0.001)
2607229:The clinicopathological characteristics of the patients included in this study are summarised in Table 1 
2607229:( B ) Right panel (ES2) showing a point mutation in the BRAF gene
2607229:The significantly higher frequency of KRAS/BRAF mutations in non-serous type carcinomas compared with conventional high-grade serous carcinomas in this study is a finding of great interest
2607229:There were no differences in intra-abdominal xenograft tumour weights between the CI-1040-treated group and control groups transplanted with the wild-type KRAS/BRA F cell line SKOV3 ( Figure 7B )
2607229:For immunosorting, fresh tumour tissues were minced and incubated with collagenase A (2?mg?ml?1) at 37?�C for 40?min
2607229:Four weeks BALB/c nu/nu mice were purchased from Charles River Japan Inc
2607229:Although there are well-established surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments for ovarian cancer, there is a significant opportunity to develop drugs targeting specific molecular pathways
2607229:The human ovarian carcinoma cell line KF28 (serous carcinoma) was a kind gift from Dr Yoshihiro Kikuchi (Ohki Memorial Kikuchi Cancer Clinic for Women, Saitama, Japan) ( Yamamoto et al , 2000 )
2607229:Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations may benefit from CI-1040 treatment
2607229:The data were expressed as a percentage of the DMSO control
2607229:Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify the effects of other BRAF mutations in ovarian cancer, and to completely describe the mutation profile of KRAS-BRAF signalling in established ovarian cancer cell lines
2607229:( A ) The CI-1040-treated ES2 cells, but not KF28 cells, show morphological features typical of apoptosis
2607229:We anaesthetised the mice before they were rendered moribund by the experiment
2607229:This difference in prognostic significance between ovarian cancer and the latter types is intriguing, and it probably reflects organ-specific roles of the KRAS/BRAF pathway
2607229:We reported earlier that KRAS or BRAF mutations were quite common in low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas but rare in conventional high-grade serous carcinomas ( Nakayama et al , 2006 )
2607229:To assess the mechanisms underlying growth inhibition by CI-1040, we measured the percentages of BrdUrd-labelled cells and Annexin V-labelled cells to estimate proliferation and apoptosis, respectively
2607229:It suggests that conventional high-grade serous and non-serous tumours may be distinguished on the basis of characteristic genetic alterations
2607229:Similar amounts of total protein from each lysate were loaded and separated on 10% Tris-Glycine-SDS polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA, USA) and electroblotted to Millipore Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
2607229:Diagnosis was based on conventional morphological examination of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and tumours were classified according to the WHO (World Health Organization) classification
2607229:The immunoreactivity of active p-ERK1/2 was detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the tumour cells ( Figure 2 )
2607229:We found that CI-1040 significantly reduced cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in cell lines with either KRAS or BRAF mutations in comparison with cell lines with wild-type sequences ( Figure 6 , Supplementary Figure 1 )
2607229:Patients with either KRAS or BRAF mutations had similar performance status distributions
2607229:Our present results showing low frequencies of either KRAS or BRAF mutations in conventional high-grade serous carcinoma are consistent with our earlier reports ( Nakayama et al , 2006 )
2607229:Indeed, PI3K signalling by either PIK3CA or PTEN mutations occurs in 40% of endometrial cancers but in <5% of ovarian cancers ( Tashiro et al , 1997 ; Oda et al , 2005 ; Kolasa et al , 2006 ; Nakayama et al , 2006 )
2607229:CI-1040 was prepared in a vehicle of 10% Cremophore EL (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 10% ethanol, and 80% water
2607229:Furthermore, they suggest that the CI-1040-induced phenotypes depend on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in ovarian cancers
2607229:An oral formulation of CI-1040 had already been shown to be an effective MEK inhibitor and was generally well tolerated in a multicentre phase II study ( Rinehart et al , 2004 )
2607229:Ovarian carcinomas with KRAS or BRAF mutation are clinically low-grade carcinomas of serous or other histological subtypes that are often refractory to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy ( Bristow et al , 2002a , 2002b ; Winter et al , 2007 )
2607229:Therefore, we analysed p-ERK1/2 expression in each of the cell lines listed in Figure 5 
2607229:Ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal malignant disease in American women ( Wingo et al , 1995 ) and the most lethal gynaecological cancer in Japan
2607229:Cell lysates were prepared by dissolving cell pellets in Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% ? -mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA)
2607229:This raises the possibility that KRAS and BRAF mutant cancer cells might be differentially dependent on signalling mechanisms that involve MEK
2607229:Effects of CI-1040 on cell proliferation
2607229:(Kanagawa, Japan)
2607229:Therefore, detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations in ovarian cancers may identify patients who will benefit from CI-1040 therapy
2607229:Cases in which more than 5% of the tumour cells showed detectable immunoreactivity were scored as positive
2607229:Out of the 58 samples that we examined, 45 were available for prognostic analysis
2607229:A set of primary cultures was established from ovarian cancers, including POC-1, POC-2, and POC-3
2607229:The MPSC1 cell line was established from a low-grade serous carcinoma and was a kind gift from Dr le-Ming Shih (Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA)
2607229:This study examined the status of KRAS and BRAF mutations, in relation to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation in 58 ovarian carcinomas to clarify the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of KRAS/BRAF mutations
2607229:( B ) A case with negative staining of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2)
2607229:As shown in Figure 1 , three ovarian cancer cell lines harboured either KRAS or BRAF mutations
2607229:Somatic mutations of either KRAS or BRAF were identified in 12 (20.6%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas
2607229:To confirm the findings of a CI-1040 effect in vitro , we injected 3 � 106 MDAH2774 or SKOV3 cells into the intraperitoneal tissue of nu/nu mice (4 weeks of age)
2607229:In addition, the biological role of this pathway in the development of ovarian cancers of other histological types is unknown
2607229:These might represent useful therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer
2607229:The percentages of BrdUrd-positive and Annexin V-positive cells were determined by counting approximately 400 cells from each well in 96-well plates
2607229:To confirm the presence of apoptotic cells, DAPI-stained cells were also stained with Annexin V dye
2607229:BRAF inhibition by small interfering RNA resulted in significantly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in the BRAF mutant lines
2607229:If this is the case, tumours arising as a result of a mutation in either KRAS or BRAF should harbour similar downstream dependencies
2607229:Thus, there is a need for an improved understanding of the molecular pathways of ovarian carcinogenesis
2607229:The most frequent genetic abnormalities in ovarian carcinoma are mutations in KRAS , BRAF, and p53 ( Singer et al , 2003 ; Nakayama et al , 2006 )
2607229:As shown in Figure 5 , four of the tumours harbouring either KRAS or BRAF mutations showed a marked reduction (<50% of DMSO control) in the cell number in the CI-1040-treated group as compared with the other 14 tumours containing wild-type KRAS and BRAF ( P <0.001)
2607229:Our findings contrast with a recent report showing a positive correlation between a KRAS or BRAF mutation and clinical aggressiveness in colorectal, non-small-cell lung, and thyroid cancers ( Lievre et al , 2006 ; Lee et al , 2007 ; Massarelli et al , 2007 )
2607229:Effects of CI-1040 in a mouse xenograft model
2607229:Interestingly, simultaneous mutations of KRAS and BRAF did not occur in the tested ovarian carcinomas with the exception of one mucinous case
2607229:Kaplan�Meier estimates of overall survival are plotted in Figure 3 
2607229:In addition, there were significant correlations between KRAS/BRA F mutations and pathological grade ( P =0.004), and histological subtype ( P =0.014)
2607229:Cells were counted after 72?h of CI-1040 or DMSO (control) treatment
2607229:Histological examination of the tumours after CI-1040 treatment showed inactivation of p-ERK1/2 in tumour cells based on immunohistochemistry ( Figure 7C and D )
2607229:Mutational status was correlated with growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 that prevented activation of the downstream target, ERK1/2
2607229:of triplicates
2607229:There was no significant correlation between KRAS/BRAF mutations and the patient's age
2607229:Profound growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed in CI-1040-treated cancer cells with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF in comparison with the ovarian cancer cells containing wild-type sequences
2607229:IOSE27, a normal OSE cell line, was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Center
2607229:SKOV3 and A2780 showed weak expression of ERK1/2.These results suggest that activation of ERK1/2 may depend on KRAS/BRAF mutation in ovarian cancer cells
2607229:Ovarian carcinomas with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF were more sensitive to growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by the MEK inhibitor, CI-1040
2607229:In contrast, this effect was not seen in the KRAS mutant lines ( Preto et al , 2008 )
2607229:OMC3 (mucinous carcinoma) and JHOC5 (clear cell carcinoma) human ovarian cancer cell lines were also obtained from Riken Bioresource Center (Ibaragi, Japan)
2607229:When the model for the mouse study was first designed, the end point was set to be the day when the mice began to produce ascites, or acute gain of weight due to tumour growth, for reasons of ethical origin
2607229:This discrepancy may be because of differences in organ-specific oncogenic pathways
2607229:A similar amount of protein was loaded in CI-1040 and DMSO-treated samples as evidenced by a similar intensity of total ERK1/2
2607229:In microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer cell lines, the effect of BRAF inhibition depended on whether the cell harboured a BRAF or a KRAS mutation
2607229:The same membrane was probed with an antibody that reacted with total ERK1/2 (1?:?5000) (Cell Signaling Technology) for loading controls
2607229:The areas for coring were selected by surgical pathologists (MF) on the basis of a review of the H&E slides
2607229:This observation suggests that ovarian carcinomas with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF are more highly dependent on the activation of the RAS�RAF�MEK�ERK pathway for cell proliferation and survival than those without such mutations
2607229:( A ) KRAS/BRAF mutational status correlates with favourable overall survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma
2607229:Most KRAS mutations were located at codon 12 and all BRAF mutations at codon 600
2607229:( A ) Intense immunoreactivity is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in this ovarian carcinoma
2607229:Activating KRAS and BRAF mutations typically show mutant exclusivity in tumours ( Brose et al , 2002 ; Davies et al , 2002 ; Gorden et al , 2003 ; Singer et al , 2003 )
2607229:In this model, conventional high-grade serous and non-serous carcinomas develop independently from one another and are characterised by different molecular genetic changes and gene expression profiles ( Schwartz et al , 2002 ; Marquez et al , 2005 )
2607229:An methyl thiazoyl tetrazorium (MTT) cell-growth assay was performed ( Nakayama et al , 2001 ) 96?h after treating the cells with CI-1040 (provided by Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA) at 5? ? M or with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (control)
2607229:In this study, 8 out of 9 KRAS/BRAF mutations were identified in early stage (stage I, II) tumours
2607229:Activation of ERK1/2 in turn activates downstream cellular targets ( Peyssonnaux and Eychene, 2001 ; Allen et al , 2003 ) including a variety of cellular and nuclear proteins
2607229:The above observations lend strong support to the view of �kinase addiction' by which the activating mutations in the kinase pathway confer susceptibility of the tumours to an inhibitor ( Sebolt-Leopold et al , 1999 ; Arteaga and Baselga, 2004 )
2607229:The findings in this study indicate that an activated ERK1/2 pathway is critical to tumour growth and survival of ovarian cancers with KRAS or BRAF mutations
2607229:A positive reaction was defined as a discrete localisation of the brown chromagen in the nucleus or cytoplasm
2607229:All mice injected with CI-1040 developed significantly smaller intra-abdominal xenograft tumours than the mice carrying diluent control cells of the KRAS mutant cell line MADH2774 ( Figure 7A )
2607229:The frequency of KRAS/BRAF mutations in conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0%?:?1/25) was significantly lower than that in the other histological type (32.3%?:?10/31)
2607229:Four mice were used for each experimental group
2607229:Primary tumour cultures were established from freshly isolated tumour samples by immunosorting or trypsinisation
2607229:For the cell-growth assay, cells were plated at the same density (3 � 103 cells per well) in 96-well plates
2607229:Western blot analysis showed a dose-dependent effect on the expression of active ERK1/2 in ES2 cells, and active ERK1/2 was not detectable 6?h after treating the cells with CI-1040 at a concentration of 5? ? M ( Figure 4 )
2607229:Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 58 ovarian cancers, including 27 serous carcinomas, 20 mucinous carcinomas, and 11 endometrioid carcinomas were used in this study
2607229:To test this hypothesis, we examined the consequences of MEK�ERK pathway inhibition using a highly potent and selective inhibitor of MEK1/2, CI-1040 (formerly known as PD184352) ( Schaeffer and Weber, 1999 ; Sebolt-Leopold et al , 1999 , 2003 ; Sebolt-Leopold, 2004 )
2607229:The frequency of either KRAS or BRAF mutations in conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0%?:?1/25) was significantly lower than in the other histological type (32.2%?:?10/31)
2607229:The data were plotted as Kaplan�Meier curves, and the statistical significance was determined by the log-rank test
2607229:In addition, our observations have an important therapeutic implication in ovarian cancer patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations
2607229:Expression of the active phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) was assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis
2607229:The time for termination of the experiment was dictated by the aforementioned ethical reasons (tumour ascites in controls), and this endpoint was observed at that time
2607229:Its frequency has increased dramatically in the last decade
2607229:Apoptotic cells were detected with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining
2607229:The data were expressed as the mean �1 s.d
2607229:The acquisition of anonymous tissue specimens was approved by the Shimane University Institutional Review Board
2607229:from triplicates
2607229:Mutations in BRAF or KRAS are correlated with overexpression of activated ERK1/2 in ovarian serous tumours ( Hsu et al , 2004 )
2607229:Next, to clarify the roles of ERK1/2 activation in ovarian cancers harbouring KRAS or BRAF mutations, we inactivated ERK1/2 in ovarian cancer cells using CI-1040
2607229:Cells carrying BRAF mutations have also been shown to be more sensitive to MEK inhibitors than cells with RAS mutations ( Solit et al , 2006 )
2607229:In light of our in vivo and in vitro findings, we propose that ovarian cancer patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations be considered for MEK inhibitor (CI-1040) therapy if they recur after conventional platinum and taxane chemotherapy
2607229:OVCAR3, SKOV3, A2780, MDAH2774 (serous carcinoma), and ES2 (clear cell carcinoma) human ovarian cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Center (Rockville, MD, USA)
2607229:( C ) Intense immunoreactivity is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in CI-1040-untreated tumour
2607229:Cl-1040 is a compound that selectively inhibits MAP kinase kinase (MEK), an upstream regulator of ERK1/2, and thus prevents ERK1/2 activation
2607229:Kaplan�Meier survival curve in 45 patients with ovarian carcinoma according to KRAS/BRAF mutation and phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) expression
2607229:However, mutations at E585K and G463E have also been reported in ovarian cancer samples and cell lines ( Davies et al , 2002 )
2607229:Therefore, CI-1040 has the potential to be developed into a drug for the treatment of ovarian carcinomas in patients with either KRAS or BRAF mutations
2607229:V600E is the most common BRAF mutation in ovarian cancer ( Singer et al , 2003 ; Sieben et al , 2004 ; Shih Ie and Kurman, 2005 ; Nakayama et al , 2006 )
2607229:( A ) Left panel (MDAH2774) showing a point mutation in the KRAS gene
2607229:Thus far, the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 has fared poorly in clinical trials for breast, colon, and lung cancer ( Rinehart et al , 2004 )
2607229:PCR was then carried out followed by nucleotide sequencing using the iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
2607229:Tumour staging was carried out according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification
2607229:OVK#18 (serous carcinoma) human ovarian cancer cell line was obtained from Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan)
2607229:Although the biological roles of the RAS�RAF�MEK�ERK pathways in human cancer have been thoroughly investigated, there have been no recent studies
2607229:Univariate analysis showed that only FIGO stage III, IV affected the overall survival of patients with ovarian carcinoma significantly( P =0.014)
2607229:Arrows represent spike which indicates mutation
2607229:A large proportion of microsatellite-stable colorectal tumour metastases has been shown to accumulate BRAF / KRAS mutations ( Oliveira et al , 2007 )
2607229:In contrast, somatic mutations of BRAF were identified in 5 (8.6%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas
2607229:The inhibitor was tested in a collection of ovarian cancer cell lines that showed differing mechanisms of MAP kinase pathway deregulation
2607229:tumours in KRAS mutant MDAH2774 cells
2607229:The acquisition of tumour tissues was approved by the Shimane University Institutional Review Board
2607229:Therefore, it is not known whether the activation of KRAS or BRAF mutations alters the effects of these pathways on tumour progression
2607229:Immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2)
2607229:( A ) CI-1040-treated cells produced small tumour nodules in the peritoneal cavity
2607229:( D ) Proliferation is estimated by counting BrdUrd-stained cells under a fluorescent microscope
2607229:In this study, we also showed that the ERK�MAPK pathway was activated in 15 (33.3%) out of 45 ovarian carcinomas and activation depended on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF 
2607229:The mean and standard deviation (s.d.) were obtained from three experiments
2607229:Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA)
2607229:Therefore, we recommend that in further clinical trials of MEK inhibitors for ovarian cancer, patients are stratified on the basis of KRAS/BRAF mutational status
2607229:The RAS�RAF�MEK�ERK pathway may play an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis but not in endometrial carcinogenesis
2607229:The Student's t -test was used to examine the statistical significance in the difference of growth-assay data
2607229:Immunohistochemistry was carried out on tissue microarrays at a dilution of 1?:?1000 followed by detection with the En Vision+ System using the peroxidase method (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA)
1557711:Seven of the cases were clinically regarded as positive for HER2 (2+ or 3+) and three were regarded as negative (0 or 1+)
1557711:Widespread DCIS was previously used for implantation in experiments similar to this study [ 20 , 21 ]
1557711:Several different farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) have been developed
1557711:JM participated in the design of parts of the study and performed the statistical analysis
1557711:Eight xenografts (in pairs) were implanted subcutaneously in four sites symmetrically in the flanks
1557711:For each of the cell lines two separate experiments were conducted and the median growth inhibition among all R115777-treated tumours was calculated
1557711:RAS pathway activity is critical for tumour growth [ 1 ]
1557711:(a) Tumour growth inhibition in MCF-7/HER2-18 tumours grown in athymic mice treated with R115777 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg
1557711:No clinical studies involving FTIs in patients with DCIS have been performed, and knowledge on ras status in DCIS lesions is sparse
1557711:The plated number of cells and the concentration of FCS were established for each cell line in separate experiments to find suboptimal growing conditions for use in the following experiments with R115777
1557711:Athymic female nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu, aged 6�8 weeks) were purchased and allowed to acclimatize for 1�2 weeks before experiments were started
1557711:Furthermore, by showing an unfarnesylated protein in treated cell pellets and cell line tumours, we demonstrated the effect on farnesylation by the FTI R115777
1557711:In breast cancers, activity of the ras signalling pathway appears to be increased chiefly via activation of wild-type ras proteins by upstream growth factor receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and c-erbB-2 (HER2) [ 2 , 3 ]
1557711:We are planning further investigations into the mechanisms of action of the FTIs and how they affect the different pathways that regulate cell survival and proliferation
1557711:Tumour growth inhibition
1557711:The ras proteins play an important role in signal transduction and cellular transformation [ 14 ]
1557711:This statistical model matched the R11577 and control readings from mice transplanted from the same women
1557711:However, in an experiment similar to ours, in which cell line tumour growth inhibition was studied and the same FTI was used, Kelland and coworkers [ 12 ] identified inhibition of about 60�70% in treated MCF-7 cell line tumours
1557711:We stratified by treatment dose of R115777, but it was not possible to compare the results between the two different doses because the number of xenografts was too small after stratification
1557711:The MCF-7/HER2-18 is a MCF-7 cell line with 45-fold over-expression of the HER2 receptor caused by transfection with full-length HER2 cDNA [ 34 ]
1557711:Nine out of the 10 women had foci of invasive cancer in their mastectomy specimen according to the final histopathological report
1557711:The take rate of DCIS xenografts has been shown to be high; furthermore, DCIS express HER2 in 70% of high-grade DCIS lesions [ 22 , 23 ], which makes DCIS suitable for studies targeting the ras pathway
1557711:NJB participated in the design and coordination of the study and helped to draft the manuscript
1557711:Inhibition of farnesylation has not been clearly correlated to tumour inhibition in cancer patients [ 44 ]
1557711:The cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mmol/l Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mmol/l NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1 mmol/l ethyleneglycoltetracetic acid, and 0.1 mmol/l EDTA) with protease inhibitors for 5 minutes on ice
1557711:In the cell tumours immunohistochemistry (TdT-mediated dUTP-fluorescence nick end labelling) was used
1557711:At least 1,000 cells were counted at a magnification of �40
1557711:Four experiments were conducted with the dose R115777 50 mg/kg and six with 100 mg/kg
1557711:Fifty-four out of 80 (67.5%) day 0 xenografts contained ducts with DCIS
1557711:Tissue from 14 women with widespread DCIS was implanted
1557711:No antiproliferative effect and no pro-apoptotic effect were seen in the k-ras mutated MDA-MB231 tumours treated with the FTI, and no tumour growth inhibition resulting from treatment was observed in this cell line
1557711:Participants in this study were women who attended the Nightingale Breast Screening Assessment Centre or the Symptomatic Breast Clinic at the University Hospital of South Manchester, UK during the period from April 2002 to April 2003
1557711:There was no statistically significant difference in body weight loss/gain or number of deaths between treated and control animals in the DCIS xenograft experiments
1557711:Accordingly, the data presented on proliferation, apoptosis and CTI are from the 10 experiments with implanted DCIS
1557711:The incidence of ras mutations in human tumours overall is about 30%, whereas the incidence of activating ras mutations in breast cancers is low, at only a few percent [ 7 - 9 ]
1557711:Median tumour volume in treated relative to control animals is given in cubic millimetres
1557711:Expression of these receptors is increased in 30�40% of all breast cancers [ 4 ]; furthermore, over-expression is indicative of a more aggressive phenotype [ 5 , 6 ]
1557711:The exact mechanism of action FTIs on cancer cells remains unknown
1557711:In four out of five treated MCF-7/HER2-18 tumours an unfarnesylated ras band was detected, whereas in six out of six control tumours no unfarnesylated ras was detected (Figure 2b )
1557711:The mechanism might be a threshold effect or due to saturable drug pharmacokinetics [ 12 ]
1557711:All treated cell pellets exhibit a high proportion of unfarnesylated protein
1557711:Other FTIs have been shown to inhibit both mutated and wild-type ras [ 30 , 31 ], but a relative resistance to FTIs in k-ras mutated cell lines has also been reported [ 32 , 33 ]
1557711:As in the work by Kelland and colleagues, we found no dose respond effect with the chosen doses, namely 50 and 100 mg/kg
1557711:Treatment was continued until untreated cells reached confluence
1557711:Furthermore, data suggest that combining STIs and endocrine therapy may be more effective than an STI alone [ 41 - 43 ]
1557711:The median age among the remaining 10 women with implanted DCIS was 53 years (range 39�72 years)
1557711:Bound antibody was detected using a horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by treating the membrane with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA) and exposing it to film
1557711:In the future, it might be possible to identify those tumours that will benefit from treatment with a FTI
1557711:Farnesylation makes the ras protein more hydrophobic, and therefore it becomes possible for the protein to attach to the plasma membrane [ 10 ]
1557711:Treatment with R115777 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg or control vehicle (20% ?-cyclodextrin) was begun when measurable tumours were formed in about 75% of injection sites
1557711:Western blots were performed on MCF-7 and MCF-7/HER2-18 cells treated with different doses of R115777 and on MCF-7/HER2-18 tumours from the in vivo experiments
1557711:The effect on the HER2 transfected MCF-7 cell line tumours was also considerably more pronounced than the effect on the SKOV3 cell tumours, and this was also reflected in a 10-fold lower IC50
1557711:Data are presented as the geometric means with their 95% confidence intervals
1557711:We have clearly demonstrated inhibition of farnesylation in vitro in the present study
1557711:The mice were housed under conventional conditions with a 12-hour cycle of light and dark in filter top cages ( n = 5�6/cage) and given free access to normal feed, water and bedding during the experiments
1557711:This selection of tumours was made in an attempt to establish proof of farnesyl tranferase inhibition in vivo 
1557711:We have shown that the effect on growth is related to a reduced CTI in the cancer cell lines tumours in vivo and that the CTI was statistically significantly reduced in human DCIS treated by the FTI after 1 week
1557711:This unfarnesylated ras band was not detected in any of the untreated cell samples (Figure 2a )
1557711:Three separate experiments were conducted for each cell line, in which each concentration of R115777 was tested in quadruplicate
1557711:Eight out of the 10 cases of DCIS were ER positive (for instance, >5% stained cells)
1557711:Tumours were selected from those tumours treated with R115777 exhibiting a good response and control tumours with no response on tumour growth
1557711:Accordingly, the overall take rate was calculated at 66.4%
1557711:The MDA-MB231 cell line also had the highest IC50
1557711:Comparisons between the R115777 treated and control samples in the DCIS xenograft experiments were made 'within-patient' using a repeated analysis of variance model with patient and group (R155777 versus control) as factors
1557711:All care of the animals and surgical procedures were performed in accordance with Home Office Regulations and the UK Scientific Procedures Act (1986)
1557711:We could not assess activation of the ras signalling pathway, but chose to study the downstream effects of the FTI, measured as change in apoptosis and proliferation
1557711:The grading was done on the in situ part only in lesions with invasive cancer
1557711:Breast cancer is potentially a suitable tumour type for study because it is possible to perform experiments similar to ours in which human tumours can be tested in a xenograft model
1557711:This might be an indication that HER2 expression plays a role in the response to farnesyl transferase in vivo 
1557711:Statistical analysis was performed using STATA software (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA)
1557711:Point mutations in ras genes result in over-activated ras proteins
1557711:Also, cell tumour growth in vivo was reduced, and we showed increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, resulting in reduced CTI
1557711:Detection of an unfarnesylated and a farnesylated band of the HDJ2 protein represents conclusive evidence of farnesyl transferase inhibition
1557711:After 2 weeks one pair of xenografts was removed and treatment was started (day 14)
1557711:We have shown that the FTI was effective in some tumours and not in others
1557711:The Western blots were transferred to polyvinyledene difluoride membrane and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against HDJ2 (KH2A5.6; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA, USA) [ 29 ]
1557711:The effect of R115777 on cell growth was used to establish the concentrations required to reduce cell numbers by 50% (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50])
1557711:This was less than the inhibition of approximately 80% we found on the MCF-7/HER2-18 tumours, using the same dose of R115777
1557711:Tumours were divided and processed for immunohistochemistry or were stored in liquid nitrogen
1557711:The CTI ratio between the start and 1 and 2 weeks of treatment were 1.99 and 1.50, respectively, for controls and 0.85 ( P = 0.005) and 0.75 ( P = 0.08) for treated xenografts
1557711:Protein extracts were prepared from cell pellets or tumours after thawing the cryopreserved samples and washing them with phosphate-buffered saline
1557711:We were unable to detect a clear relationship between any of the factors and the effect of the FTI
1557711:RBC participated in the design and coordination of the study
1557711:In this study we demonstrated reduced tumour growth in vivo and reduced cell growth in vitro in human cancer cell lines with wild-type ras and varying levels of growth factor receptors, when treated with the FTI R115777
1557711:The ras pathway is activated by a variety of extracellullar factors [ 10 ] and aberrant function of the ras signal transduction pathway is thought to be common in breast cancer [ 2 ]
1557711:Another pair of xenografts was removed after 7 days of treatment (day 21), and the remaining xenografts were removed after 14 days of treatment (day 28) at the end of the experiment
1557711:There is a lack of correlation between preclinical results with FTIs and results from clinical studies
1557711:After retrieval, the xenografts were immediately fixed in buffered formalin for 24 hours at 4�C and then stored in 70% ethanol before paraffin embedding
1557711:In mice, growth of MCF-7/HER2-18 tumours was inhibited by R115777 50 mg/kg ( n = 19) and 100 mg/kg ( n = 11) by 80.8% (interquartile range 56.4�99.0%; P = 0.001) and 95.9% (68.2�110.1%; P = 0.02), respectively, compared with control tumours ( n = 22; Figure 1a and Table 1 )
1557711:All counting was performed without knowledge of treatment group
1557711:However, the effect was not as clear as in the in vitro setting and varied among the treated tumours
1557711:Overall, CTI decreased in treated xenografts
1557711:The protein concentration of each lysate was quantified using a colorimetric assay (BCA Protein Assay; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and 50 ?g total protein was loaded on an 8% SDS polyacrylamide gel
1557711:We also demonstrated an effect on farnesylation in cell tumours, with good response to R115777 treatment
1557711:In a phase II study of continuous and intermittent dosing of R15777 in women with advanced breast cancer [ 37 ], partial response or stable disease was demonstrated in about 20% of treated women
1557711:The remaining xenografts were implanted into 5�30 mice, depending on tissue volume
1557711:IC50 for R115777 varied a hundred-fold, from 39 nmol/l and 46 nmol/l for SK-BR3 and MCF-7 to 2.7 ?mol/l and 5.9 ?mol/l for SKOV3 and MDA-MB231 cell lines, respectively, when grown in vitro (Table 1 )
1557711:There is a need to identify the targets of the FTIs in the preclinical setting if we are to understand the clinical results and be able to select patients in future studies
1557711:For example, the IC50s in the MCF-7 and in the MCF-7/HER2-18 were not significantly different in the in vitro experiments
1557711:Women were included in the study if they had mammograms showing widespread microcalcifications indicative of DCIS, with or without an invasive component, and histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis by core biopsy before surgery ( n = 14)
1557711:FK participated in the design of the study, classified the human DCIS tissue and helped with the counting of proliferation and apoptosis in tumour cells
1557711:The FTI R115777 is a promising new treatment for breast cancer
1557711:The breast cancer cell lines were chosen based on their different expression of growth factor receptors, and the SKOV3 ovarian cell line was used as a model for oestrogen receptor (ER) negative and wild-type ras cancer
1557711:The cell lines considered in our in vitro experiments were selected to represent different expressions of growth factor receptor and ERs
1557711:Each experiment was terminated and all tumours were removed when any of the mice developed a tumour burden of more than 1 cm3
1557711:Statistical significance of tumour growth inhibition was tested by comparing individual tumour growth in cubic millimetres between treated and control tumours using the Mann-Whitney U test
1557711:Although we were unable to establish the ras status of the DCIS lesions in our human DCIS xenograft experiments, the majority (70%) were HER2 positive and would be expected to have activated wild-type ras
1557711:The specimen was dissected into 2 � 2 � 1 mm pieces and a random collection of 5�10 pieces was withdrawn as day 0 samples and processed for histology
1557711:In treated DCIS xenografts proliferation decreased and apoptosis increased
1557711:One way to target ras activity is to inhibit the enzyme farnesyl transferase, which catalyzes a major step in the modification of pro-ras
1557711:To assess apoptosis in the xenografts, we sought morphological evidence of apoptosis using haematoxylin and eosin stained sections
1557711:In the experiments involving the oestrogen-dependent MCF-7/HER2-18 cell line, oestrogen pellets (2 mg) were implanted subcutaneously at the base of the tail of the mice at the time of cell injection [ 24 ]
1557711:CTI = cell turnover index; DCIS = ductal carcinoma in situ ; ER = oestrogen receptor; FCS = foetal calf serum; FTI = farnesyl transferase inhibitor; IC50 = 50% inhibitory concentration; PI3K = phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; STI = signal transduction inhibitor
1557711:In the xenograft experiments no difference in body weight was seen between R115777 and controls; neither was there any difference in the number of deaths seen between treated and control animals
1557711:The cell tumours chosen in this analysis were MCF-7/HER2-18 tumours showing good response on R115777 treatment and MCF-7/HER2-18 control tumours with uninhibited growth
1557711:The results of growth inhibition in vitro were in accordance with the in vivo results (for instance, the largest effect on tumour growth in vivo was seen in the cell line with the lowest IC50 in vitro )
1557711:Other studies [ 11 , 13 ] also were unable to show a clear relation between markers such as growth factor receptors and ras status, and the effect of FTIs
1557711:Other ras-independent mechanisms of action might play a role in the antitumour effect, including inhibition of enzymes other than the farnesyl transferases [ 44 , 45 ]
1557711:Cells were plated in 96-well plates in growth medium containing 2�5% foetal calf serum (FCS), and after 24 hours the medium was discarded and replaced with medium containing varying concentrations of R115777 (0, 1 nmol/l, 10 nmol/l, 100 nmol/l, 500 nmol/l, 1 ?mol/l, 5 ?mol/l and 10 ?mol/l)
1557711:The type of tumours that respond to farnesyl transferase inhibition must be established before the treatment can become clinically useful

1557711:(a) Detection of an unfarnesylated and a farnesylated band of the HDJ2 protein by Western blot technique on cell pellets treated with different doses of R115777 and controls
1557711:(c) Tumour growth inhibition by R115777 in MDA-MB231 tumours
1557711:The drug investigated in this study (R115777) is an imidazole-based FTI that acts as a competitive inhibitor of the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide CAAX of ras [ 16 - 19 ]
1557711:All authors read and approved the final manuscript
1557711:Activation of the RAF-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway stimulates proliferation in the cell, and activation of the PI3K-PKB (protein kinase B)/Akt pathway is related to increased cell survival [ 15 ]
1557711:Approval to remove tissue from pathological samples in this study was granted by the South Manchester Research Ethics Committee
1557711:The harvested xenograft pairs contained DCIS in 44.8% (493/1100)
1557711:The effect on the CTI was due to both an antiproliferative and a pro-apoptotic effect
1557711:The significance level was set at 5% and all tests were two sided
1557711:However, all results of proliferation and apoptotic change in the different groups pointed in the same direction, except for an unchanged apoptotic index after seven days of treatment in the lower dose group
1557711:(b) Detection of an unfarnesylated and a farnesylated band of the HDJ2 protein by Western blot technique on MCF-7/HER2-18 cell tumours treated with R115777 or control vehicle
1557711:However, if some mixture of invasive cancer cells had occurred in the xenografts, then this should have been evenly distributed between controls and treated animals, therefore causing no bias
1557711:Apoptosis increased in the treated DCIS xenografts
1557711:This indicates that mechanisms other than farnesyl transferase inhibition are involved in tumour growth inhibition
1557711:To function in signal transduction and activation of downstream pathways ras must attach to the plasma membrane where it can interact with membrane receptors and downstream effectors such as RAF and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
1557711:Estimation of cell number was done by means of the sulphorhodamine B colorimetric assay
1557711:A 1�2 cm3 specimen of breast tissue from the area with microcalcifications was taken at the time of surgery and handled as described previously [ 20 , 21 ]
1557711:Clinical studies of R115777 in phase I trials have shown that a reversible myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity of the drug [ 35 , 36 ]
1557711:EA participated in the design and coordination of the study
1557711:Each mouse received tissue from one patient only and implantation was completed within 90 min of removal of the tissue from the patient
1557711:In all MCF-7 and MCF-7/HER2-18 cell samples treated with different doses of R115777 in vitro , an unfarnesylated ras band was detected with Western blot technique
1557711:A series of new signal transduction inhibitors (STIs) are under development [ 40 ]
1557711:The research was partly sponsored by Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, New Jersey, USA
1557711:(b) Tumour growth inhibition by R115777 in SKOV3 tumours
1557711:Forty-one of the primary tumours in the study conducted by Johnston and coworkers [ 37 ] were analyzed for ras mutations and only one tumour had an h-ras mutation
1557711:In one study [ 38 ] two out of 25 DCIS lesions over-expressed wild-type k-ras, and in another study [ 39 ] four out of five DCIS patients expressed detectable plasma levels of wild-type ras, but no ras mutations were found in these studies
1557711:The ras pathway is essential for cell growth and proliferation
1557711:At least 300 cells in the xenografts and 1,000 cells in the cell tumours were counted at a magnification of �40
1557711:Ras is synthesized as a pro-peptide (pro-ras)
1557711:FW participated in the design of the study, carried out the cell and tumour experiments, obtained patient consent and collected human DCIS tissue, performed part of the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript
1557711:We found no areas of invasive breast cancer in our day 0 xenografts
1557711:No correlation between response and ER and/or HER2 expression was seen in the study
1557711:Farnesyl transferase inhibition in vitro and in vivo 
1557711:We also tried to relate the effect of the FTI to growth factor receptor status and ras status
1557711:In four out of five treated tumours an unfarnesylated protein was detected.
1557711:Only tumours that were measurable at the start of treatment were included in the analyses
1557711:Cells (2�4 � 106) in a 200 ?l solution of growth medium containing 10% FCS were injected subcutaneously into each flank of each mouse and allowed to form tumours
1557711:Tumours were measured with a calliper twice weekly and tumour volume was calculated using the following formula: tumour volume = (width)2 � (length/2)
1557711:In four of the cases no DCIS was found in the day 0 xenografts or in the implanted xenografts, and these women were excluded from further analyses
1557711:DW participated in the design of the study, carried out the cell and tumour experiments, and carried out the immunoassays and Western blots
1557711:Data were restricted to those mice with tissue from women with readings available from both R115777 and control mice
1557711:Written consent was obtained, and only those women undergoing mastectomy were included
1557711:We did not study the effect of the FTI in subgroups of DCIS (for example, ER positive/negative or HER2 positive/negative)
1557711:Preclinical data have suggested that ras inhibition has an inhibitory effect on growth in cell lines that express both mutated and wild-type ras [ 11 - 13 ]
1557711:Nine lesions were nuclear grade III and the remaining lesions were nuclear grade II
1557711:The growth inhibitory effect of R115777 was calculated using the following formula: 1 - ([D - C]/[Bmedian - Amedian]) � 100%, where D is the final tumour volume after R115777 treatment, C is the tumour volume before R115777 treatment, B is the median final tumour volume among control tumours after treatment, and A is the median tumour volume among control tumours before treatment
1557711:R115777 is a promising treatment for breast cancer but the relation between effect and growth factor receptor and ras status has to be established
1557711:The tissue was collected well away from any areas showing signs of invasive cancer on the mammogram, and in our day 0 xenografts we found no signs of invasive cancer
1557711:By gaining a better understanding of how different interactions in normal or upregulated or downregulated signal pathways work, we hopefully will be able to tailor breast cancer treatment to individual patients
1557711:A consultant breast pathologist subsequently reviewed all tissue samples
1557711:The immunohistochemistry methodology and apoptotic scoring was described previously [ 21 , 25 - 27 ]
1557711:The ras pathway is activated by a variety of extracellullar factors, and aberrant function of ras signal transduction is not only due to ras mutations
2361104:The adenoma�carcinoma sequence is well accepted as a major pathway for the development of colorectal cancers (CRCs) ( Morson, 1968 )
2361104:BRAF mutations were detected in four out of 46 of FDNs (9%) and none of the 57 PNs
2361104:Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5?min
2361104:However, this abnormality in FDNs might occur via the genetic alteration other than BRAF or KRAS mutation
2361104:Protruding neoplasias were defined as protruding lesions with or without stalks (sessile, semipedunclated, or pedunculated lesions)
2361104:The remaining findings were novel mutations, P452T (exon 11) in two tumours and T588I (exon 15) in one tumour
2361104:However, we observed no significant difference in the incidence of BRAF mutations between FDNs with and without MSI-H
2361104:In our series, all of the mutations in exon 15 of BRAF observed in depressed neoplasias (DNs) involved conversion of valine to glutamic acid at codon 599 (V599E)
2361104:We evaluated the incidence of BRAF and KRAS mutations, high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H), and the immunohistochemical status of p-MAPK in the nonserrated neoplasias (46 FDNs and 57 PNs)
2361104:Davies et al (2002) have reported the presence of BRAF mutations in human cancers such as melanomas, colorectal, and ovarian cancers
2361104:These primers included the region of mutation �hot spots' previously identified in this gene
2361104:Sections were incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Anti-ACTIVE MAPK pAb; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 4�C
2361104:DNA samples from normal colonic mucosa (frozen or formalin-fixed tissue) or peripheral blood were used as normal controls for molecular analysis
2361104:Additionally, mutational activation of KRAS has been found in about 40% of colorectal neoplasias ( Bos et al , 1987 ; Forrester et al , 1987 )
2361104:There was no significant difference in the type B and C immunostaining of p-MAPK between FDNs with and without BRAF mutations
2361104:Other histopathological features were determined according to the general rules of the Japanese Research Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum ( Japanese Research Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum, 1997 )
2361104:Each immunostained section was examined under a light microscope and evaluated for the nuclear staining ( Figure 1A ) twice by a senior pathologist (MT) who did not have any knowledge of the clinical and molecular analysis of those samples
2361104:The dysplastic or normal mucosa glands were divided into three equal areas (upper, middle, and lower)
2361104:Immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MAPK)
2361104:Although some molecular differences between flat-depressed neoplasias (FDNs) and protruding neoplasias (PNs) have been reported, it is uncertain if the BRAF mutations or the status of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MAPK) are different between theses two groups
2361104:A tumour sample was considered to contain high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) if two or more of the five informative markers demonstrated instability, and was considered to have low-frequency MSI (MSI-L) when only one marker was unstable ( Boland et al , 1998 )
2361104:All PCR reactions were repeated on the same sample and only consistent changes in the duplicate reactions were scored as abnormalities
2361104:Olschwang et al (1998) reported that eight out of 36 flat colorectal neoplasias showed MSI-H (22%)
2361104:Type B/C immunostaining of p-MAPK was observed more frequently in the large PNs than in small PNs
2361104:BRAF and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in the morphologically distinct nonserrated neoplasias (FDNs and PNs, respectively)
2361104:KRAS mutations were observed in none of 46 FDNs and 14 out of 57 of PNs (25%)
2361104:To our knowledge, this is the first study of the mutational status of BRAF in terms of the morphological characteristics of colorectal nonserrated neoplasias
2361104:Sections were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-binding amino-acid polymer for 30?min (Histofine Simplestain MAX-PO kit, Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan)
2361104:Five microsatellite loci analysed in this study were BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250 ( Boland et al , 1998 )
2361104:In contrast, type B/C immunostaining for p-MAPK was detected more frequently in large (?10?mm) than small (<10?mm) PNs
2361104:This specifically recognises the dually phosphorylated, active form of MAPK (p44/ERK1 and p42/ERK2)
2361104:Therefore, it is possible that some FDNs with BRAF mutation or MSI-H progress to de novo type cancers (ie, flat or depressed cancers without accompanying adenoma)
2361104:For the MSI analysis, MSI-H was shown in seven out of 44 FDNs (16%) and in one out of 52 PNs (2%)
2361104:Specimen collection procedures and genetic analysis were approved by the ethical committee of Showa University School of Medicine
2361104:P-MAPK-positive cells were classified into three types ( Figure 1 ): type A, localised within the upper area only; type B, localised in the upper and middle; type C, localised in the upper through lower
2361104:We observed no significant difference in the incidence of type B/C immunostaining of p-MAPK between FDNs with and without BRAF mutations
2361104:Although we need more extensive analysis, V599E mutations might contribute to tumorigenesis in DNs
2361104:PCR was performed to amplify DNA samples from the tumours and the adjacent normal tissues using an established PCR protocol ( Konishi et al , 2004 )
2361104:The p-MAPK protein was detected immunohistochemically in all samples to a variable extent
2361104:We excluded patients who had familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancers, or hyperplastic polyposis, and patients with sporadic SAs
2361104:Mutational screening of the BRAF and KRAS genes was performed by direct sequencing methods, as previously reported ( Makino et al , 2000 )
2361104:If representative tumour samples contained less than 80% tumour cells, separate samples were obtained from the histological slide for tumourous or adjacent normal tissue using laser-capture microdissection, as described previously ( Yamamoto et al , 2003 )
2361104:The KRAS gene mutation frequency in colorectal polyps increases in proportion to their size ( Vogelstein et al , 1988 )
2361104:Of the 14 PNs with KRAS mutations in this series, 11 (79%) were adenomas
2361104:Somatic mutations of the Ras gene, leading to activation of this signalling pathway and malignant transformation, are frequently observed in protruding tumours ( Fujimori et al , 1994 ; Minamoto et al , 1994a ; Yamagata et al , 1994 ; Yashiro et al , 2001 ; Chan et al , 2003 )
2361104:BRAF mutations are frequently observed in SAs or hyperplastic polyps ( Chan et al , 2003 ; Kambara et al , 2004 ; Konishi et al , 2004 )
2361104:A single observer (HN) performed the MSI analysis, and positive or equivocal samples were re-evaluated by a second observer (KN)
2361104:A value of P <0.05 was considered significant
2361104:The other non-V559 mutations detected here were the novel mutations, P452T (exon 11) and T588I (exon 15), in CRCs
2361104:PCR amplification of exon of a KRAS-containing codon 12 or 13 was performed using previously described primers ( Brose et al , 2002 )
2361104:Derangement of the MAPK pathway in FDNs might occur via the genetic alteration other than BRAF or KRAS mutation
2361104:KRAS mutations were observed in none of FDNs and in 14 PNs (25%; P =0.0002 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:Deparaffinised and rehydrated sections were heated in a microwave oven in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 30?min to retrieve antigens
2361104:Of the seven FDNs with MSI-H, four were adenomas and three were Duke's type A carcinomas, whereas one PN with MSI-H were adenomas
2361104:According to the criteria described previously ( Konishi et al , 1999 ), tumour location was classified into three groups: rectum, left-colon (left-c), and right-colon (right-c)
2361104:As more than 70% of FDNs show positive immunostaining of p-MAPK, this signalling pathway may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of FDNs
2361104:BRAF proteins, Ras-regulated kinase, phosphorylate MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn phosphorylate MAPK-ERK 1/2
2361104:Abnormal accumulation of p-MAPK protein is more likely to be implicated in the tumorigenesis of FDNs than of PNs
2361104:Dysplastic mucosal lesions were classified as adenomas
2361104:However, about 80% of the adjacent normal mucosa showed type A p-MAPK expression
2361104:Tumours showing novel peak patterns were evaluated as MSI positive
2361104:Recently, molecular characteristics of serrated adenomas (SAs) are reported to be different from those of nonserrated neoplasia
2361104:Colour was developed by staining with a diaminobenzidine solution
2361104:Of the seven FDNs with MSI-H, four were adenomas and three were Duke's A carcinomas
2361104:The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of BRAF mutations in a sizable number of FDNs and its implication for KRAS mutations, for MSI, and for the immunohistochemical status of p-MAPK, and to compare these genetic and immunohistochemical characteristics of FDNs with PNs as controls
2361104:Therefore, further investigation is required to clarify what leads to the tumour-specific expression of p-MAPK in FDNs
2361104:No KRAS mutation was observed in any PN with MSI-H
2361104:We found MSI-H in seven of 44 FDNs (16%) but in only one of 52 PNs (2%)
2361104:However, the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is regulated via the interaction with and modulation of the function of a wide range of signalling proteins ( English et al , 1999 ; Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999 ; Kolch, 2000 )
2361104:Mutational activation of KRAS is a rare event in FDNs, compared with PNs ( Fujimori et al , 1994 ; Minamoto et al , 1994a ; Yamagata et al , 1994 ; Yashiro et al , 2001 )
2361104:Some molecular differences between FDNs and PNs have been reported
2361104:All but one KRAS mutation was detected in codon 12 of the KRAS gene ( Table 2 )
2361104:This group accounts for at least two thirds of all CRCs
2361104:Flat-depressed neoplasias were subclassified into flat or depressed neoplasias, depending on whether a depressed component was present
2361104:We identified four FDNs (9%) with mutations in BRAF , but no PNs with the mutations
2361104:There are also distinct differences in chromosomal changes between FDNs and PNs ( Richter et al , 2003 )
2361104:MSI-H was detected in seven out of 44 FDNs (16%) and in one out of 52 of PNs (2%) ( P =0.022 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:Thus, we evaluated these statuses between flat-depressed and protruding nonserrated neoplasia
2361104:BRAF mutations in these cancers are oncogenic
2361104:On the other hands, there was no significant difference in the incidence of type B/C immunostaining of p-MAPK between FDNs with and without BRAF mutations
2361104:Our immunohistochemical data suggest that alterations of the MAPK pathway are important for the development of FDNs, but may also highlight new therapeutic strategies for dealing with CRCs that arise from FDNs
2361104:Mann�Whitney U- test, ? 2 test, and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis
2361104:The major group is characterised by a mechanism associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which accounts for a significant proportion of tumour suppressor gene (adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) or p53 ) inactivation ( Baker et al , 1989 ; Powell et al , 1992 )
2361104:Selection of tumour samples may explain this difference
2361104:There was no significant difference in the incidence of type A p-MAPK expression in the adjacent normal mucosa between FDNs and PNs (34 out of 46 and 42 out of 50, respectively; P =0.2241 by ? 2 test)
2361104:In summary, BRAF and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in the morphological characteristics of colorectal nonserrated neoplasias
2361104:One tumour had BRAF mutations in both exons
2361104:This research was supported in part by a Special Research Grant-in-Aid for Development of Characteristic Education from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan
2361104:The incidence of accompanying adenoma in the Duke's type A carcinomas was lower in the FDNs than in the PNs (four out of 17 and 12 out of 13, respectively; P =0.0002 by Fisher's exact test) ( Table 1 )
2361104:BRAF mutations were found in one out of seven FDNs with MSI-H (14%) and in three out of 37 FDNs without MSI-H (8%)
2361104:We thank Ms Yoshiko Sasaki (Second Department of Pathology, Showa University School of Medicine) for her excellent technical assistance in this study
2361104:Small nonpolypoid cancers have particularly greater aggressiveness than polypoid cancers of equivalent size ( Minamoto et al , 1994b )
2361104:In the FDNs, type B/C expression of p-MAPK was observed significantly more frequently in Duke's A carcinomas than in the adenomas ( P= 0.0338 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:Thus, molecular analysis of FDNs is important for achieving a better understanding of the mechanism in the development of CRCs
2361104:Inactivation of this gene, which resulted from bialleleic hypermethylation of the promoter, leads to destabilisation of simple DNA repeat sequence in colorectal tumours ( Cunningham et al , 1998 ; Herman et al , 1998 )
2361104:Type B and C immunostaining for p-MAPK was observed in 34 out of 46 FDNs (72%), compared with 24 out of 55 PNs (44%; P =0.0022 by ? 2 test)
2361104:P-MAPK forms (phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2) translocate to the nucleus to modulate gene expression through the activation of transcriptional factors ( Peyssonnaux and Eychene, 2001 )
2361104:However, these differences were not statistically significant
2361104:Abnormal accumulation of p-MAPK protein seems to be more frequently implicated in the tumorigenesis of FDNs than that of PNs
2361104:Thus, abnormal accumulation of p-MAPK protein is more likely to be associated with the tumorigenesis of FDNs than of PNs
2361104:Moreover, no significant mutations in ARAF or RAF-1 have been found in CRCs ( Fransen et al , 2004 )
2361104:At the present, there are no validated criteria for evaluating immunohistochemical staining for p-MAPK; therefore, we used a grading system for evaluating p-MAPK staining based on staining distribution
2361104:High-frequency microsatellite instability was significantly more frequently seen in FDNs than in PNs
2361104:The extraction of genomic DNA was described previously ( Yamamoto et al , 2003 )
2361104:The mutational spots of BRAF gene cluster within the activation segment (exon 15) and the G-loop (exon 11) of the kinase domain, which are highly conserved among serine/threonine kinases throughout evolution
2361104:Many have reported CRCs arising from FDNs or nonpolypoid neoplasias ( Shimoda et al , 1989 ; Bedenne et al , 1992 ; Iishi et al , 1992 ; Kudo, 1993 ; Minamoto et al , 1994b ; Konishi et al , 1999 ; Rembacken et al , 2000 ; Kaneko et al , 2004 )
2361104:Most CRCs are thus believed to arise from pre-existing adenomatous polyps
2361104:BRAF mutations were detected in four FDNs (9%) and none of PNs ( P =0.0369 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:All mutations were reconfirmed by independent PCR reactions and sequencing
2361104:Three BRAF mutations were found in exon 15 and two were in exon 11 ( Table 2 )
2361104:BRAF and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive in the morphological characteristics of colorectal nonserrated neoplasia
2361104:Type B and C immunostaining for p-MAPK was observed in 34 out of 46 FDNs (72%), compared with 24 out of 55 PNs (44%)
2361104:CI-1040 (PD184352) is highly selective inhibitor of the MAPK signalling cascade specifically targeting the inhibition of MEK ( Delaney et al , 2002 )
2361104:Therefore, the mutational type of KRAS might activate the MAPK pathway more strongly than the wild-type KRAS ( Vojtek and Der, 1998 )
2361104:By contrast, KRAS mutations were observed in none of FDNs and in 25% of PNs
2361104:Genetic alterations in the adenoma�carcinoma sequence comprise two groups ( Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996 )
2361104:Type B/C immunostaining of p-MAPK was more common in Duke's A carcinomas than in adenomas of FDNs
2361104:Most of these benign precursor lesions are of polypoid, protruding origin ( Muto et al , 1975 ); however, many investigators have reported flat and depressed neoplasias (FDNs) as a new type of precursors of CRC and propose that these tumours develop through a de novo pathway, as they are not associated with adenoma components ( Bedenne et al , 1992 ; Iishi et al , 1992 ; Kudo, 1993 ; Minamoto et al , 1994b ; Konishi et al , 1999 ; Rembacken et al , 2000 ; Saitoh et al , 2001 )
2361104:( C ) In type C, p-MAPK-positive cells were localised in the upper, middle through lower area of the tumour (� 10).
2361104:To extract genomic DNA, five adjacent sections (5- ? m thick) were obtained from an archival block of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissue for each macroscopic type
2361104:The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and eluted with GenElute� Minus EtBr Spin Columns (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA)
2361104:Primers for exons 11 and 15 were used to evaluate BRAF mutations ( Davies et al , 2002 ; Chan et al , 2003 )
2361104:The purified sample was sequenced using an automated sequencer
2361104:However, no significant difference in incidence has been observed for somatic mutations in APC and p53 ( Olschwang et al , 1998 ; van Wyk et al , 2000 )
2361104:There were no significant differences in gender, age, family history of CRC, location, size, or histology between the two macroscopic types
2361104:This implies that abnormal accumulation of p-MAPK protein may be a critical event in the tumour progression of FDNs, independently of BRAF mutations
2361104:Serial sections (3? ? m) were cut from paraffin blocks, and prepared for hematoxylin�eosin (HE) staining and immunostaining
2361104:Unfortunately, two paired PNs and adjacent normal mucosa, and five samples of adjacent normal mucosa were not informative for p-MAPK immunostaining, because of the small amounts of tissue in the blocks
2361104:Continuous activation of the MAPK signalling pathway is of critical importance for the development of CRCs
2361104:The working dilution was 1?:?300
2361104:Flat-depressed and protruding adenomas may be the precursors to cancers arising de novo and to polypoid cancers, respectively
2361104:Antitumour activity was found to correlate with CI-1040-mediated inhibition of phosphorylated ERK levels
2361104:Flat-depressed neoplasias are characterised by a higher potential of malignancy than protruding neoplasias (PNs) ( Kudo, 1993 )
2361104:This difference was statistically significant ( P =0.0022 by ? 2 test)
2361104:We compared the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics between neoplasia with type A and with type B/C immunostaining of p-MAPK ( Table 3 )
2361104:One section was stained with HE, and the percentage of tumour cells was estimated microscopically
2361104:This size-related difference was statistically significant ( P= 0.0265 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:Nuclear staining was observed here as a positive reaction for p-MAPK protein, and type B and C immunostaining of p-MAPK was frequently observed in the FDNs or PNs
2361104:Mutational activation of BRAF or KRAS gene signals act through the classical MAPK cascade to promote proliferation ( Davies et al , 2002 )
2361104:Moreover, BRAF mutations occur in a mutually exclusive relationship with KRAS mutations, and are closely related to the carcinogenesis of sporadic CRCs with high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) ( Rajagopalan et al , 2002 ; Wang et al , 2003 )
2361104:Previous studies ( Rajagopalan et al , 2002 ; Wang et al , 2003 ; Domingo et al , 2004 ; Koinuma et al , 2004 ) have reported that BRAF mutations occur more frequently in microsatellite-unstable than in microsatellite-stable CRCs
2361104:This difference was statistically significant ( P =0.0369 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:MSI-L was shown in 16 out of 44 FDNs (36%) and in six out of 52 PNs (12%: P =0.0066 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:The incidence of type B and C immunostaining of p-MAPK was significantly higher in the FDNs than in the PNs
2361104:Protruding neoplasias have a significantly higher frequency of KRAS mutation than flat neoplasias, despite the similarity of the tumour size ( Fujimori et al , 1994 ; Minamoto et al , 1994a ; Yamagata et al , 1994 ; Yashiro et al , 2001 )
2361104:In our series, 41% of FDNs showed depressed type morphology and about two-thirds of FDNs were 10?mm or more in diameter
2361104:This V599E mutation is a �hot spot' mutation of colorectal cancers, as well as other human cancers ( Davies et al , 2002 ; Rajagopalan et al , 2002 ; Wang et al , 2003 ; Yuen et al , 2003 ; Domingo et al , 2004 ; Fransen et al , 2004 ; Koinuma et al , 2004 )
2361104:Thus, derangement of the MAPK signalling pathway may be an early, size-dependent event in the tumorigenesis of PNs, and correlates to the status of KRAS mutation
2361104:BRAF mutations have been reported in approximately 10% of CRCs ( Davies et al , 2002 ; Rajagopalan et al , 2002 ; Fransen et al , 2004 )
2361104:However, BRAF mutations are infrequent in FDNs
2361104:We found that type B/C expression of p-MAPK was more frequently observed in PNs with a KRAS mutation
2361104:( A ) Nuclear expression in a colonic neoplasia
2361104:A series of 57 endoscopically or surgically resected PNs were used as controls
2361104:Of the four FDNs with BRAF mutations, no BRAF mutation was detected in the adjacent normal mucosa
2361104:This incidence of MSI-H differed significantly between FDNs and PNs ( P =0.022 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:Type B/C immunostaining of p-MAPK was demonstrated more frequently in PNs with KRAS mutations than without KRAS mutations ( P= 0.0272 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:BRAF status has been examined in a variety of human malignancies
2361104:However, Yashiro et al (2001) observed no significant difference in the incidence of MSI-H between flat-type and polypoid-type cancers (four out of 25 and zero out of 25, respectively)
2361104:Another group of cancers exhibits a high frequency of DNA microsatellite instability (MSI) caused by inactivation of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes such as hMLH1 ( Bronner et al , 1994 )
2361104:There was significant difference in the incidence of KRAS mutations between FDNs and PNs ( P =0.0002 by Fisher's exact test)
2361104:However, they also suggested that some flat neoplasias may progress to de novo cancers with LOH at chromosome 3p, the location of hMLH1 , and this could explain the onset of MSI-H as an alternative mechanism to hypermethylation of the promoter of hMLH1 
2361104:The Ras/Raf/MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (MEK is the MAPK or extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) kinase) cascade mediates cellular response to growth signals ( Peyssonnaux and Eychene, 2001 )
2361104:The activated version of BRAF , at least in part, promotes cell proliferation by signalling through MEK and ERK ( Davies et al , 2002 )
2361104:We analysed the immunostaining of p-MAPK separately in tumour and adjacent normal tissue
2361104:This T588I mutation may be associated with increased MAPK activity because the tumour with this mutation showed a type B and C expression of p-MAPK protein
2361104:Tumour suppressor gene inactivation occurs as a consequence of the state of microsatellite instability
2361104:Briefly, FDNs were defined as slightly mucosal elevations with a flat or slightly rounded surface and a height of less than half of the diameter of the lesions, usually consisting of dysplastic mucosal thickness less than twice that of the adjacent nondysplastic mucosa by histology
2361104:However, the status of the BRAF gene in the precursor lesions of CRCs has not been thoroughly explored, and there is morphological heterogeneity in the oncogenesis ( Shimoda et al , 1989 )
2361104:This research was also supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (14-36)
2361104:The frequency of MSI-H in that series did not differ with regard to the histological type
2361104:Macroscopically, each neoplastic lesion was classified as an FDN or a PN, according to the modified criteria described previously ( Konishi et al , 2003 )
2361104:A total of 46 FDNs from 44 patients who underwent endoscopic ( N =33) or surgical resection ( N =13) at Showa University Hospital between April 1998 and January 2004 were used for this study
2361104:All HE-stained sections were reviewed by a single pathologist (YH), who was blinded to the colonoscopic findings
2361104:When tumour cells had spread through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa, the lesion was defined as a carcinoma
2361104:( B ) In type A, p-MAPK-positive cells were localised within the upper area of the adjacent normal mucosa (� 10)
2361104:Sections were lightly counterstained with haematoxylin
2361104:However, it remains unknown whether BRAF mutations or the status of phosphorylated MAPK (p-MAPK) are the contributors to the tumorigenesis of FDNs, a new type of precursors of CRC
2361104:Two exon 15 mutations observed in depressed neoplasias were the conversion of valine to glutamic acid at codon 599
2361104:Therefore, inhibition of either p-MAPK or related molecule might be a new therapeutic strategy to treat these CRCs
2361104:However, this accumulation was significantly correlated with the incidence of KRAS mutations in PNs, but not to that of BRAF mutations in FDNs
2663546:The quality of isolated DNA was analyzed through a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis
2663546:They are mitogenic to vascular endothelial cells and induce vascular permeabilization [ 11 ]
2663546:The non response group was defined by serum M-protein levels that had decreased to < 25% or by urine BJ protein levels that had decreased to < 50% of initial levels
2663546:Since it is known that gene alterations may be linked with cytokine modulation, we analyzed the incidence (%) of K- ras mutations in MGUS and MM subjects, due to the emerging role of this gene in plasma cell dyscrasia pathogenesis [ 29 , 30 ]
2663546:IGF-I concentration was determined as serum immunoreactivity using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) technique (Quantikine� R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and expressed as ng/mL
2663546:In the same subjects, basic FGF and VEGF, have been detected
2663546:Another molecule involved in MM biology is IGF-I, a mediator with cytokine (locally)/hormone (in the general circulation) activity [ 36 ], known to be a growth promoter for several tumours, including MM, acting through its anti-apoptotic/proliferative [ 16 , 19 , 37 ] effects and interaction with angiogenic factors, such as the anti-proliferative TGF-beta1 [ 38 ]
2663546:In this regard, there are several reasons supporting the fact that ras gene represents an interesting case for studying the impact of cancer-associated genetic mutations and tumour angiogenesis
2663546:Scarce angiogenic activities have been found in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) as compared to the overt malignant forms, where marrow neoangiogenesis parallels tumour progression and correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting an angiogenesis-dependent regulation of disease activity [ 5 - 7 ]
2663546:FP collected the biological samples and patient's clinical data
2663546:When K12- ras mutation and the levels of the 3 cytokines under or above cut offs were combined, no significant differences were found in the different subgroups (data not shown)
2663546:This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited
2663546:VEGF and b-FGF serum concentrations were highly correlated (P = 0.002), confirming the results previously published by other authors [ 8 ]
2663546:In general, angiogenic mediators (VEGF, basic FGF, TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha) have been found to be increased in MM patients and often significantly correlated each to the others [ 8 ]
2663546:None of them showed any abnormalities concerning basic laboratory tests and no detectable infection was observed
2663546:Angiogenic factors also show different behaviours under treatment
2663546:In conclusion, as previously reported for other neoplastic diseases [ 42 , 51 ], serum IGF-I concentrations are clearly reduced in case of open disease
2663546:The present study is aimed to explore this point comparing 55 healthy subjects, 71 monoclonal gammopaties of uncertain significance (MGUS) and 77 overt MM patients
2663546:Neoangiogenesis is under the control of various cytokines, that are expressed by neoplastic plasma cells, so that their involvement in MM pathophysiology has been strongly supported by different reports [ 8 ]
2663546:In particular, c-myc deregulation by PDGF-BB has been demonstrated either in normal [ 21 ] or in tumour cells [ 22 ]
2663546:Then new cycles of therapy were administered because of tumour progression
2663546:Serum levels of IGF-I in patients affected with multiple myeloma (MM) have been scarcely studied
2663546:A multivariate analysis corrected for age and gender confirmed the significant difference only for IGF-I values (P = 0.01)
2663546:The inter-assay CV reported by the manufacturer varies from 6.2% to 8.8% for VEGF and 7.4% to 9.1% for bFGF
2663546:In fact, activated ras is capable of triggering several crucial signalling cascades, so altering the expression of some members of ras -responsive genes, many of which could be relevant for triggering or contributing to tumour angiogenesis [ 25 ]
2663546:A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the significances observed for IGF-I concentrations in the three groups were independent of age and gender and the relative p was 0.01
2663546:GV participated in the design and results discussion of the ELISA experiments
2663546:The second patient (panel B), which had a normal serum IGF-I (51 ng/ml) concentration at diagnosis, did not respond to treatment and with the exception of an IGF-I reduction observed 10 months after starting therapy, he showed only slight modifications of both serum variables during the course of disease
2663546:MM patients were classified as stage I or II when analysed at the onset of the disease and were treated with conventional therapeutic regimens including melphalan (0.25 mg/Kg body weight/day) and prednisone (2 mg/Kg body weight) for 4 consecutive days
2663546:K- ras gene alteration has previously been associated with the modulation of different biological agents, including IGF-I [ 23 , 24 , 44 , 45 ]
2663546:In addition, we tried to determine whether the serum levels of these cytokines combined with the K- ras gene alterations might allow to select groups of patients with different responsiveness to chemotherapy
2663546:The multivariate logistic regression analysis has been applied by using the SPSS version 6.0 for Microsoft Windows 95/98
2663546:The patient responded to treatment for about 10 months (s-M protein = 6 g/l; serum IGF-I level = 101 ng/ml), then relapsed again
2663546:This report primarily employed univariate analysis of the data by means of non parametric tests (Mann and Whitman or Kruskall Wallis variance analysis for quantitative and corrected X square or Fisher's exact test for categorical data)
2663546:The response was defined as minor response when the serum M-protein had decreased by > 25% but < 50% or the urinary BJ had decreased by >50% but not to < 0.2 g in 24 h
2663546:Several authors tried to explain how angiogenic cytokines [ 4 , 31 ] may work influencing the MM cells; consequently, in the recent years, the presence and quantity of several angiogenic factors, their inducers and their signalling mediators have been documented in an effort to explore the possibility to use them as diagnostic, monitoring or prognostic markers of disease evolution and therapy sensitivity
2663546:Figure 1 shows two of them presenting at least six/seven observation times in which consecutive serum samples from the time of diagnosis until death were analyzed
2663546:CG and FA conceived of the study, discussed the results and wrote the manuscript
2663546:IGF-I is a mitogen and anti-apoptotic cytokine/growth factor/hormone produced by several types of cells (fibroblasts, hepatocytes, chondroblasts ..) [ 15 ]
2663546:Moreover, it has been suggested that circulating levels of IGF-I and its inhibitory binding proteins (IGF-BP 1�6) may be associated with an increasing risk of common cancers [ 17 ]
2663546:This logistic regression analysis employed as end point the four variables subdivided into two groups of subjects exceeding or not the cut off value (i.e
2663546:A statistically not significant trend (p = 0.07) was also observed for the serum bFGF concentrations when comparing responders (mean = 1.9 pg/ml; range = 1.2�20.8 pg/ml) with non responders (mean = 3.8 pg/ml; range = 1.3�19.6 pg/ml)
2663546:When necessary, samples with levels higher than the maximum standard of the calibration curve were repeated after dilution
2663546:The first arrow indicates when MP treatment started, according to the protocol described in "Methods; the others two arrows indicate the repetition of new cycles of therapy due to disease progression
2663546:This model applies the stepwise logistic regression ("SPSS backward LR method")
2663546:These findings open the possibility that IGF-I molecule might be further studied as a monitoring marker to follow the patients over time by specific trials
2663546:Therefore, a clinical use of serum determinations of this molecule should be made very carefully since this substance does not show a clear specificity for MM
2663546:These results show that, generally, serum IGF-I concentrations behave similarly to the monoclonal component
2663546:However, data concerning their potential prognostic power as well as their reciprocal interactions are still conflicting [ 8 - 10 ] and remain to be better elucidated
2663546:Significant reductions of IGF-I levels were observed in MGUS and MM as compared with healthy controls
2663546:Concerning IGF-I, two representative monitoring examples have also been added
2663546:VEGF expression is regulated by several factors including interleukins (IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10), fibroblast growth factor (FGF-4) and insulin-like growth factor1(IGF-1) [ 12 ]
2663546:Moreover, the existence of a relationship between activation of ras oncogenes and regulation of the VEGF/VPF expression has been demonstrated in experimental [ 23 ] and clinical [ 24 ] studies
2663546:Fifty-five healthy blood donors were used as controls
2663546:As expected, none of the control specimens analyzed manifested gene alterations (Table 3 )
2663546:No statistically significant differences between K- ras gene status and serum factor concentrations were found for IGF-I or VEGF
2663546:The K- ras gene mutations were present in only one (1,5%) MGUS subject and in twenty (27,4%) MM ones
2663546:RV carried out PCR experiments on K-ras gene mutation and ELISA assays., GV participated in the revision of the manuscript, DG and IS performed statistical analysis
2663546:A p < 0.05 cut off has been employed for the significance evaluation
2663546:The main circulating component of IGF-I is released by the liver under GH control, while locally, different regulatory mechanisms have been reported [ 18 , 19 ]
2663546:Among innovative treatments, antiangiogenic therapy seems to represent a promising approach, whose rationale is based on tumour growth inhibition by starving cancer cells of vital nutrients [ 2 ]
2663546:Two representative examples are shown in Figure 1 Serial measurements of IGF-1 and serum M-Protein (s-MP) from diagnosis (0) to last follow-up before death in two MM patients 
2663546:To analyze the basal characteristics of the subjects studied in this report (Table 1 ), we have tabulated the data concerning the main clinical features subdivided into three groups, namely: 55 healthy blood donors, 71 MGUS and 77 MM
2663546:The serum levels of IGF-I were significantly and sequentially reduced from controls to MGUS and from MGUS to MM
2663546:K12- ras mutation was significantly associated with malignancy, response to therapy and with significantly increased serum bFGF levels
2663546:Data from literature showed that IGF-I molecules may be modulated by SOCS genes, after their activation by proinflammatory cytokines [ 37 ]
2663546:DNA was extracted from bone marrow aspirates using the MICRO-GENO DNA kit (AB Analitica, Padoa, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions
2663546:All determinations were performed in duplicate in only one analytical set; the ELISA test sensitivity, expressed as mean minimal detectable dose (MDD), was < 5 pg/ml for VEGF and 3 pg/ml for bFGF
2663546:Also bFGF presented significantly different serum values among the three groups
2663546:A correlation matrix using the values of the four variables in MGUS or MM groups only resulted significant for VEGF vs b FGF (r = 0.37, p = 0.002) in MGUS patients
2663546:The present study clearly shows that the serum IGF-I concentrations significantly decreased from healthy blood donors to MGUS and to MM patients, a finding not previously described
2663546:The multivariate analysis, corrected for age and gender, did not reach a statistical significance (p = 0.9)
2663546:Intermediate situations were categorized as a no change disease
2663546:Recent evidences indicate that angiogenic processes are increased and are fundamental not only in solid tumours but also in hematologic diseases, including MM, as well [ 3 , 4 ]
2663546:Either patients or healthy blood donors were admitted after giving informed consent
2663546:No significant variations were registered for the gender in the three comparisons, while age significantly differed when control subjects were compared with MGUS or MM
2663546:The intra-assay CV varies from 5.1% to 6.7% for VEGF and 3% to 9.7% for bFGF
2663546:In spite of the progresses recently registered in the therapy of multiple myeloma (MM), the prognosis for patients affected by this disease remains still poor [ 1 ]
2663546:It is also possible to speculate that the cytotoxic effect of therapy should release a great amount of endocellular molecules from necrotic cells with induction of inflammatory processes and IGF-I drop
2663546:The patient groups, whose main clinical features are reported in Table 1 , included 71 monoclonal gammapathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) and 77 multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed and staged according to Durie & Salmon criteria [ 26 ]
2663546:Mutations at K- ras codon 12 (G G T?G C T) were detected from all samples by an "enriched" restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) assay according to Kahn SM et al
2663546:Seventy-three MM patients showing or not K- ras gene mutations were analyzed for their response to therapy
2663546:It is known that all cancers, including MM, possess a more or less strong inflammatory component (in particular the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha are produced by myeloma cells) and that inflammation is associated with reduced IGF-I synthesis [ 43 ]
2663546:A trend in lower serum bFGF levels was observed when responders MM patients were compared with the non responder ones
2663546:It binds to a family of four distinct, high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR-1�4) and stimulates endothelial cell proliferation in vitro [ 13 ]
2663546:Seventy-one out of the total were patients affected by MGUS and 77 were patients with MM, these latter receiving treatment with conventional chemotherapy (Melphalan/Prednisone)
2663546:Such divergence may depend on some patient characteristics
2663546:The angiogenic factors (VEGF and bFGF) were measured with a quantitative ELISA (Quantikine� and Quantikine�; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions and expressed as pg/ml
2663546:Besides univariate analysis, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed and the significances were adjusted for age and gender
2663546:Despite this bulk of information, clear indications have not been completely gained and some different contrasting results have been published [ 4 , 8 , 9 , 32 - 34 ]
2663546:[symbols: cube = IGF-I; diamond = s-M protein]
2663546:The detection of serum cytokines was performed on peripheral blood samples processed within 1 h after venipuncture by centrifugation (1500 gfor 10 min) Serum samples were collected from MGUS and MM patients as well as from 55 healthy blood donors and were stored at -70�C until testing
2663546:A 5-year survival for MM patients is about 25% with less than 5% alive subjects after 10 years [ 1 ]
2663546:Therefore, we show two representative examples of MM patients followed during subsequent courses of therapy and whose disease behaviour was related to the monoclonal component concentrate on and serum IGF-I levels over time
2663546:MCP participated in the study design and in the discussion of clinical data
2663546:A similar analysis, obtained separately in male or female patients, confirmed our findings (data not shown), indicating that gender was not the cause of the differences previously described
2663546:Some of the divergences observed may be explained by the fact that various eveniences may influence the serum IGF-I levels: age and gender [ 47 ], inflammatory processes [ 48 ], other concomitant diseases [ 49 , 50 ], endocrine diseases [ 47 ], nutrition [ 47 ], drug administration and liver toxicity
2663546:New treatment was then initiated, but the patient died after about 5 months
2663546:These modulators include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), that have been extensively investigated in biological samples derived from MM patients
2663546:Several patients were followed up during therapy
2663546:A previous study by Standal and coworkers [ 39 ], failed to observe significant differences between MM and controls
2663546:Aim of the present study was to evaluate the serum levels of a panel of three cytokines, such as IGF-I plus two angiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF in 148 patients with plasma cell dyscrasias
2663546:Test sensitivity of IGF-I was 0.026 ng/ml while the inter-assay CV reported by the manufacturer for IGF-I vary from 7.5% to 8.1% and the intra-assay CV from 3.5% to 4.3%
2663546:Another variable considered in this study was the K- ras gene whose mutation was significantly associated with the malignancy [ 29 , 30 ], while no significant difference was observed between controls and MGUS
2663546:In addition, MM subjects showed significantly decreased serum IGF-I levels than MGUS
2663546:Cytokine determinations were performed by commercially available ELISA kits, while K12- ras mutation was investigated on genomic DNA isolated from bone marrow cell specimens by RFLP-PCR assay
2663546:For example, Standal selected only patients with 69% of advanced tumour stages (III), while our patients were prevalently of tumour stages I and II
2663546:Considering the results of the present study, we tried to evaluate the possibility that IGF-I might be used as monitoring marker
2663546:The first patient (panel A) had a high serum IGF-I (165 ng/ml) level at diagnosis
2663546:As previously mentioned, chronic B cell leukaemia showed data similar to those reported in our paper [ 42 ]
2663546:Conversely, increasing levels were observed for bFGF and VEGF, molecules significantly correlated
2663546:Furthermore, melphalan therapy, which is hepatotoxic and therefore should reduce IGF-I synthesis, has been reported to increase IGF-I molecules after the 4th course [ 40 ], possibly when it was effective in restoring the peripheral blood IGF-I amounts
2663546:Free IGF-I (molecules unbound to IGF-BPs) acts through a specific high-affinity IGF-I receptor, but also insulin receptor and IGF-II receptor may be used although with lower affinities [ 20 ]
2663546:All three mediators were analyzed in function of K- ras mutation and melphalan response
2663546:Sometimes, they were also stage related, although not all the reports were consistent in this field
2663546:MM demonstrate a progressive, usually fatal, course with traditional treatments, generally producing only temporary remissions
2663546:EC discussed the results and helped to draft the manuscript.
2663546:All contributing authors declare that no actual or potential conflicts of interest do exist
2663546:[ 27 ], as previously described [ 28 ]
2663546:The median serum levels and ranges of three cytokine: IGF-I, bFGF and VEGF, compared with those of healthy controls were reported in Table 2 
2663546:These two groups of patients were compared with 55 controls represented by healthy human blood donors
2663546:Although the mechanisms governing the expression of angiogenic cytokines in tumour cell by dominantly acting oncogenes is largely unknown, the regulatory effect of oncogenes on angiogenic mediators has some potentially important therapeutic consequences and needs to be better investigated, especially on hematologic malignancies
2663546:Serum MP concentrations were derived from medical records
2663546:Surprisingly, serum data regarding IGF-I and MM are very scarce and partially contrasting [ 39 , 40 ] although IGF-I is suspected to be able to transform MGUS in MM [ 41 ]
2663546:One hundred and forty-eight patients affected with plasmacell dyscrasia were consecutively admitted to the Regina Elena Cancer Institute of Rome and entered this study
2663546:In order to avoid potential platelet interference with the VEGF concentration, for each patient or control subject the serum values were corrected for their relative platelet counts
2663546:MM evolution has been shown to be strongly conditioned by angiogenic mechanisms in terms of growth and therapy sensitivity
2663546:Mutations at K- ras codon 12 were analyzed on genomic DNA isolated from bone marrow cell specimens of the two groups of patients
2663546:This is not so surprising in that the IGF-I determinations were obtained from sera of subjects already affected with MM
2663546:The significances between these three groups were always < 0.0001
2663546:VEGF is a major regulator of tumour-associated angiogenesis exhibiting various biological activities, including regulation of embryonic stem cell development and local generation of inflammatory cytokines [ 11 ]
2663546:Recent data from the literature seem to support the idea of a functional link existing between the induction of angiogenesis-mediated growth factor expression and gene alterations in tumour development
2663546:the median value of the relative controls)
2663546:Opposite to IGF-I was the behaviour of VEGF and bFGF, whose concentrations were increased in MM sera as compared with control samples
2663546:In fact, it was observed a highly significant (p < 0.0001) difference between the controls and MM or between MGUS and MM, while no significance was found between controls and MGUS groups (p = 0.95) by means of a two by two comparison of the three groups (controls, MGUS and MM) concerning the distribution of K- ras gene mutation, Interestingly, significant increases (P = 0.02) of serum bFGF levels were observed in patients showing K- ras gene mutation (median = 4.6 pg/ml; range = 1.2�19.6 pg/ml) as compared with those in which the gene was in the wild type form (median = 2.2 pg/ml; range = 1.0�20.8 pg/ml)
2663546:As shown in Table 3 , the presence of K- ras mutations was significantly associated with a lower response to Melphalan as compared with the wild type K- ras subjects (p = 0.015)
2663546:The course was repeated at every 6th week until tumour progression)
2663546:Moreover, the same K12- ras mutation was significantly associated with increased resistance to the therapy (Table 3 )
2663546:A similar difference was registered between the controls and the MM patients (p = 0.02), while, in contrast, MGUS and MM showed similar results (p = 0.27)
2663546:VEGF, finally, did not show significant variations in the four comparisons (p at least > 0.14) and the multivariate analysis, performed as above, was also not significant (p = 0.08)
2663546:This result was also independent of age (significantly lower in controls) and sex, as confirmed by multivariate regression analysis, both in all subjects and when only IgG MM patients were considered (data not shown)
2663546:A possible role of IGF-I as putative monitoring marker of malignant disease seems to emerge by our study, even though specific clinical trials need to be planned and the possible interference of other factors in serum determinations should be considered
2663546:Therefore, therapy effect was only dependent on K- ras mutation and not on cytokine levels
2663546:In an attempt to find a link between the response to therapy (yes/not), K- ras gene status (mutant/wild type) and the cytokine level (greater or lower than cut-off), we could only confirm the strong influence of K- ras gene status rather than the level of the four different cytokines in determining the therapy response of MM patients (data not shown)
2663546:He showed a minor response to treatment for a least 15 months, with a 26% fall in serum M-protein concentration and a concomitant slight reduction of IGF-I amounts
2663546:Some of the myeloma patients, selected for having at least 6 subsequent determinations and from whom venous samples had been drawn at regular intervals starting from diagnosis, were included for a detailed analysis of the IGF-I changes during the clinical course of the disease (about 2.5 years)
2663546:In addition, these significances were more pronounced than those observed for bFGF and VEGF
2663546:This molecule is normally bound to heparin and heparan sulphate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, particularly in the basement membranes, around vessels and stromal cells
2663546:In particular, there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) between the controls and the MGUS patients, in which higher values were observed
2663546:Coefficients of variation (CV) for the different cytokines obtained repeating 5 times the same samples did not exceed 15%
2663546:Its potential role as a growth factor for myeloma cells has been deeply analyzed and data of Ge NL et al [ 16 ] suggest that IGF-I significantly contributes to the expansion of MM cells in vivo by activation of two distinct pathways: Akt/Bad and MAPK kinase
2663546:Previous data on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia have found a clear reduction of IGF-I in sera as compared with controls [ 42 ], even though the studies were initially expected to exibit increased concentrations, due to the tumourigenic activity of IGF-I
2663546:VEGF gene encodes for at least five isoforms which are anchored to the extracellular matrix through the heparin-binding domains
2663546:IGF-I reduction in the transition: Controls?MGUS?MM and changes observed over time suggest that IGF-I should be furtherly studied in future clinical trials as a possible monitoring marker for MM
2663546:bFGF is an 18 to 24 kD polypeptide, mainly produced by cells of mesenchymal origin, which shares a key role of mediator of angiogenesis with VEGF in vitro [ 13 ] and in vivo [ 14 ]
2663546:As reported for solid tumours [ 47 ], we found significant increases of serum bFGF concentrations in MM patients eliciting K- ras gene activation
2663546:Due to the presence of low-molecular weight fragments of isolated DNA, 66 out of a total of 71 MGUS samples and 73 out of a total of 77 MM samples were considered suitable for genetic analyses
2663546:Interestingly, while conventional therapy (melphalan plus prednisolone) reduced the serum concentrations of these factors [ 35 ], an anti-angiogenic therapy based on thalidomide plus dexamethasone was accompanied by increase of the same factors in the responder subjects [ 4 , 34 ]
2480968:The major target of LKB1 kinase activity is thought to be AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
2480968:We detected 34 LKB1 mutations (11%) in the NSCLC tumour specimens ( Table 1 )
2480968:This was advantageous as the entire coding region of LKB1 could be rapidly screened for a mutation using just two overlapping cDNA fragments
2480968:In contrast in KRAS mutant cancers, a concurrent LKB1 mutation may be required to enhance mTOR activation
2480968:Future studies may need to employ a combination of LKB1 mutation detection methodologies including the current method, MLPA and direct sequencing
2480968:This method includes amplification of region of interest with PCR, SURVEYOR endonuclease digestion of the products, which cleaves mismatched heteroduplex DNAs, and detection of DNA fragments by sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) WAVE HS system
2480968:Only frozen tumour tissues from adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (according to the 2004 World Health Organization histopathological criteria) were included
2480968:SURVEYOR-WAVE analysis of exons 5�9 showed novel peaks for the NCI-H23 cell line as well
2480968:If we did not reject that the odds ratios were the same across ethnic groups, we then tested whether the common odds ratios were unity based on the stratified Mantel�Haenszel estimate ( Breslow and Day, 1980 )
2480968:RT�PCR revealed no major difference in LKB1 mRNA expression levels between LKB1 mutant or wild-type cell lines ( Figure 1A )
2480968:In all 109 tumours obtained during the same time period were excluded because they did not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria
2480968:We next used the SURVEYOR-WAVE method to screen NSCLC tumour specimens ( n =310) for LKB1 mutations
2480968:AD362 tumour had novel peaks in ex5�9 amplicon corresponding to deletion of exon 6
2480968:Interestingly, a significant portion of the mutations was located in exon 1 ( n =11, 32%) but there was no area of recurrent mutations in this exon ( Table 2 )
2480968:We have recently described a rapid and sensitive enzymatic method to detect mutations in epidermal growth factor ( EGFR ) of DNA from fresh tissue and paraffin-embedded tissues ( Janne et al , 2006 )
2480968:It is possible that in EGFR mutant lung cancers there is already maximal activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway and thus an LKB1 mutation may not be required to further potentiate this signalling pathway
2480968:Previous reports ( Sanchez-Cespedes et al , 2002 ; Carretero et al , 2004 ) and Cancer Genome Project by Sanger Institute ( Bamford et al , 2004 ) have extensively characterised LKB1 mutations in NSCLC cell lines with KRAS and BRAF mutations, but LKB1 status of EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines has not been extensively analysed
2480968:LKB1 mutation frequency was higher in NSCLC tumours of US origin (17%) compared with 5% in NSCLCs of Korean origin ( P =0.001)
2480968:The remainder was missense ( n =7, 21%) and nonsense ( n =2, 6%) mutations ( Table 2 , Figure 1C )
2480968:Somatic mutations of the LKB1 tumour suppressor have rarely been found in cancers from patients who do not have PJS except for NSCLC ( Avizienyte et al , 1999 )
2480968:HPLC tracings of SURVEYOR-WAVE mutation analysis of NSCLC cell lines A549, H1395, or H23 (continuous line), and H441 (dashed line)
2480968:We detected a concurrent LKB1 mutation in one of the four BRAF mutant tumours ( Table 3 )
2480968:Furthermore, LKB1 mutations have been shown to be associated with adenocarcinoma histology, male gender, and smoking history ( Matsumoto et al , 2007 )
2480968:Each of the microdissected tumour tissues with a tumour cell content of more than 90% was placed in 1?ml Easy Blue reagent of a commercially available RNA isolation kit (easy-spin� Total RNA Extraction Kit, iNtRON Biotechnology, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), immediately homogenised by vortexing, and the total RNA was extracted
2480968:Specimens were then loaded to the WAVE HS HPLC (Transgenomics, Omaha, NE, USA) at 50�C, eluted with an increasing acetonitrile gradient, and detected by UV detector using DNA intercalating fluorescence dye (Transgenomics, Omaha, NE, USA)
2480968:When cell lines known to be homozygous for specific mutation were analysed, PCR products were mixed 1?:?1 with PCR products of a wild-type cell line, denatured by heating, and slowly renatured to generate heteroduplexes
2480968:These findings are in contrast to EGFR mutations, which are more frequently detected in tumours from never/light cigarette smokers and from Asian patients ( Janne and Johnson, 2006 )
2480968:The US cohort also included nine specimens from adenosquamous carcinomas and two out of nine (22%) had LKB1 mutations, which is similar to the frequency in adenocarcinomas in this population ( Table 1 )
2480968:After adjusting for ethnic group, the higher rate of LKB1 mutation among patients with a smoking history is borderline significant (stratified P =0.067)
2480968:The areas that had the same mutation in more than one tumour specimen included deletion of exon 4 ( n =4), deletion of exons 2 and 3 ( n =3), D194Y ( n =2), and P281L ( n =2)
2480968:Medical records and haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of the specimen were reviewed by a single pathologist
2480968:This is in contrast to the findings in the Asian patients where all of the LKB1 mutations were detected in adenocarcinomas (9 out of 113 (8%)) and none were detected in squamous cell cancers (0 out of 54 (0%); P =0.032)
2480968:Cell line specimens were snap frozen and stored at �80�C
2480968:A549 and H1395 show novel peaks (*) in the amplicon covering exons 1�5 (ex1�5) corresponding to 109C>T, Q37X and 165_169delG, frameshift and truncation (FS truncation) mutations
2480968:Only frozen tumour tissues with a tumour cell content of more than 70% were used for further analysis
2480968:Mutation analysis of LKB1 gene in NSCLC cell lines and tumours
2480968:The analysis from H23 demonstrates novel peaks in the amplicon covering exons 5�9 (ex5�9) corresponding to 996G>T, W332X mutation
2480968:Differences in histological subgroups were relatively modest in the US cohort with mutations in 18 out of 94 (19%) adenocarcinomas vs 5 out of 38 (13%) in squamous cell cancers ( P =0.461)
2480968:Therefore, we analysed the LKB1 genotype of NSCLC cell lines with known EGFR or ERBB2 mutations
2480968:For SURVEYOR-WAVE mutation analysis of BRAF , cDNA was amplified in two overlapping amplicons (5?-aggatttcgtggtgatggag-3?, 5?-gatgacttctggtgccatcc-3?, and 5?-gacgggactcgagtgatgat-3?, 5?-ggtatcctcgtcccaccata-3?) covering codons 387�673
2480968:The relationship between LKB1 mutations and clinicopathological characteristics and other common oncogene mutations in NSCLC is inadequately described
2480968:Collected fragments were amplified with PCR using the same primers as in the original amplification, purified and sequenced as previously described above
2480968:No germ line DNA was available from this patient
2480968:Our study analysed tumours from different histologies and of both a US and Korean origin to determine potential histological and ethnic variation in LKB1 mutational frequency
2480968:This study is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health 1RO1CA114465-01 (BYY, BEJ, and PAJ), the National Cancer Institute Lung SPORE P20CA90578-02 (BYY and BEJ), American Cancer Society RSG-06-102-01-CCE (BYY and PAJ), Finnish Medical Foundation (JPK), Finnish Cultural Foundation (JPK), and Academy of Finland (JPK)
2480968:Male PJS patients (age ?50 years) have an increased risk of developing lung cancer compared with the general population but the relationship of smoking and the increased risk of lung cancer in PJS is unknown ( Hearle et al , 2006 )
2480968:As our findings in NSCLC cell lines suggested concurrency of KRAS or BRAF and mutual exclusiveness of EGFR mutations with LKB1 mutations, we analysed the mutational status of these genes in our primary NSCLC tumour specimens
2480968:The majority of the LKB1 mutations detected was deletions or insertions ( n =25, 74%)
2480968:Findings from our study confirm the high frequency of LKB1 mutations in NSCLC (11%), which in contrast, are rare (0�4%) in other common solid malignancies ( Avizienyte et al , 1998 , 1999 )
2480968:There was no association between LKB1 mutations and the clinical stage of the NSCLC patients
2480968:AMPK is activated under low cellular energy conditions by raising AMP levels and it phosphorylates multiple downstream targets including tuberosclerosis complex 2 gene, which represses mTOR signalling
2480968:The large size of our study enabled us to study associations of LKB1 mutations with clinocopathological factors, which have been incompletely characterised in previous studies ( Sanchez-Cespedes et al , 2002 ; Carretero et al , 2004 ; Fernandez et al , 2004 ; Matsumoto et al , 2007 ; Onozato et al , 2007 )
2480968:RT�PCR amplification of cDNA from LKB1 wt (H441) and LKB1 mutant (A549, H1395, and H23) cell lines display the full length LKB1 mRNA (1.4?kbp) while the LKB1 mutant cell line, H2126 with a deletion of exons 4�6 expresses a shorter mRNA (1.0?kbp) ( A )
2480968:In addition, our method is limited to the analysis of fresh tumour specimens, which are available only from the minority of NSCLC patients
2480968:Tumours were obtained from patients of US ( n =143) and Korean ( n =167) origin and screened for LKB1 , KRAS , BRAF , and EGFR mutations using RT�PCR-based SURVEYOR-WAVE method followed by Sanger sequencing
2480968:These included NCI-H441 (wild type) and A549, NCI-H1395, NCI-H23, and NCI-H2126 (all containing LKB1 mutations)
2480968:There were no correlations between LKB1 mutations and gender or age of a patient
2480968:The tumour with a concurrent EGFR and LKB1 mutation had a missense mutation of LKB1 outside the kinase domain (R426W)
2480968:The mutation frequency of LKB1 gene was significantly higher in NSCLCs in the Caucasian cohort ( Table 1 )
2480968:Four BRAF mutations (1%) were found in the tumour set (G465V, N581S, L596R, and T599I) and one of these (N581S) occurred concurrently with LKB1 mutation ( P =0.373)
2480968:These differences also track with cigarette smoking, as the number of never/light former smokers was much higher in the Korean cohort compared with the US cohort of patients (38 vs 13%)
2480968:The present study characterised LKB1 mutation frequency in NSCLC using one of the largest tumour sets to date ( n =310)
2480968:No LKB1 mutations were detected in these cell lines ( Table 4 )
2480968:The primers for the second amplicon located at exon 5 (5?-aacggcctggacaccttct-3?) and to noncoding exon 10 (5?-gaaccggcaggaagactgag-3?) generating a product of 702?bp, which has an overlapping part with first amplicon
2480968:In brief, PCR products were digested in reaction mixture containing equal volumes of SURVEYOR enzyme (Transgenomics, Omaha, NE, USA) and Enhancer (Transgenomics, Omaha, NE, USA) at 42�C for 20?min followed by termination of the reaction by Stop Solution (Transgenomics, Omaha, NE, USA)
2480968:A549, NCI-H1395, NCI-H1666, NCI-H23, NCI-H2122, NCI-H2126, and NCI-H460 have previously been reported to contain LKB1 mutations ( Sanchez-Cespedes et al , 2002 ; Bamford et al , 2004 ; Carretero et al , 2004 )
2480968:Kaplan�Meier survival curves of stages I and II NSCLC patients showed a tendency for shorter survival in patients with LKB1 mutant tumours but this, however, did not reach statistical significance ( P =0.17) ( Figure 2 )
2480968:Our studies further highlight ethnic and environmental differences in the origins of NSCLC
2480968:We did not have access to the corresponding normal tissues and therefore, we could not verify if some of the missense mutations were somatic or germline
2480968:The quantity and quality of RNA were analysed using a spectrometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Rockland, DE, USA) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit, Agilent Technologies Inc., B�blingen, Germany), respectively
2480968:In contrast, there was a significant inverse relationship of LKB1 mutations with EGFR mutations in both NSCLC tumours and cell lines, which has not previously been described ( Tables 3 and 4 )
2480968:In this study we evaluated tumour specimens from 310 patients with NSCLC including those with adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma histologies
2480968:Each specimen was associated with an immediately adjacent sample embedded for histology in an optimal cutting temperature medium and stored at ?80�C
2480968:Twelve EGFR mutant and one ERBB2 mutant cell lines were analysed for LKB1 genotype
2480968:The major advantages of SURVEYOR-WAVE method are the fast exclusion of wild-type specimens without laborious conventional sequencing and high sensitivity
2480968:Of the missense mutations detected in the current study, all except R426W are in the kinase domain of the protein
2480968:The LKB1 mutation rate tended to be higher in adenocarcinomas (13%) compared with squamous cell carcinomas (5%) ( P =0.067)
2480968:Analysis of LKB1 mutation harbouring NSCLC cell lines (A-427, A549, NCI-H1395, NCI-H1666, NCI-H2122, NCI-H2126, NCI-H23, and NCI-H460) showed that five of the cell lines (63%) had concurrent LKB1 and KRAS mutations, two (25%) had concurrent LKB1 and BRAF mutations, and only one (13%) had neither KRAS nor BRAF mutations
2480968:For SURVEYOR-WAVE analysis of KRAS , PCR primers (5?-ggcctgctgaaaatgactga-3?, 5?-tcctgagcctgttttgtgtct-3?) were designed to generate an amplicon of 407?bp covering codons 12, 13 and 61, which are the codons commonly mutated in lung cancers
2480968:We used combined data from previous papers ( Sanchez-Cespedes et al , 2002 ; Carretero et al , 2004 ) and from Sanger institute's databases ( Bamford et al , 2004 ) to analyse association of LKB1 mutations with mutations of KRAS , BRAF , and EGFR 
2480968:LKB1 is serine�threonine kinase, which has been shown to regulate cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cell polarity ( Tiainen et al , 1999 )
2480968:Interestingly, the LKB1 mutation spectrum found in the current study is very similar to those previously published for PJS (deletions 34%, insertions 15%, splice site mutations 14%, missense mutations 21%, and nonsense mutations 12%) ( Launonen, 2005 ) and, as in PJS, no clear mutational hotspots were detected
2480968:Furthermore, as techniques isolating mRNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour specimens continue to improve, this rapid mutation scanning technique can be used to analyse broader populations of tumours from NSCLC patients
2480968:The overall risk for cancers is increased 5- to 12-fold in different age groups compared with the general population ( Hearle et al , 2006 )
2480968:The impact of the stability of LKB1 mRNA on detecting LKB1 mutations was tested using RT�PCR with mRNA extracted from NSCLC cell lines that had previously been characterised for LKB1 mutations
2480968:In addition, frozen tumour tissues of the following patients were excluded from the study: patients who had received preoperative neoadjuvant treatments, patients with double primary lung cancer, and patients who had undergone incomplete resections or who had not been subjected to mediastinal lymph node dissections
2480968:In our study, we were not able to detect a significant survival difference for patients whose tumours contained LKB1 mutations alone or concurrently with KRAS mutations (data not shown) likely because of the limited number of tumour specimens
2480968:We detected mutations in the LKB1 gene in 34 tumours (11%)
2480968:This study showed that lkb1 inactivation in combination with activating mutations of kras using inducible promoters in the lung was associated with decreased survival compared with kras mutation alone ( Ji et al , 2007 )
2480968:Peutz�Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is caused by mutations in the LKB1 tumour suppressor gene ( Hemminki et al , 1998 )
2480968:For SURVEYOR-WAVE analysis of EGFR , PCR amplification was done in a single amplicon (5?-ggagcctcttacacccagtg-3?, 5?-aggtcatcaactcccaaacg-3?), which covered exons 18�21 of the gene
2480968:Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan�Meier method, with differences between the groups compared using the log-rank test
2480968:Given the differences in LKB1 mutation frequencies in smokers vs never/light smokers and in the US compared with Korean patients, we further determined whether these were also associated with other oncogene mutations known to vary in these subgroups of patients
2480968:The hallmarks of PJS include mucocutaneous pigmentation and hamartomatous polyps of the gastrointestinal tract
2480968:In addition, we used a modification of a sensitive mutation screening technique that we have previously developed to facilitate the rapid detection of LKB1 mutations ( Janne et al , 2006 )
2480968:We could not detect the LKB1 mutation of H2126 cell line with SURVEYOR-WAVE method using a two-amplicon approach because this cell line has a homozygous deletion of exons 4�6 and the reverse primer of the first amplicon and the forward primer of the second amplicon, which lie on the deleted part of the gene (data not shown)
2480968:The SURVEYOR-WAVE method is more sensitive than conventional sequencing as it can detect mutant DNA sequences when they are present in 1% or more of total DNA ( Janne et al , 2006 )
2480968:PCR primers of the first amplicon were designed to hybridise to the noncoding area of the mRNA upstream of exon 1 (5?-agggaagtcggaacacaagg-3?) and to exon 5 (5?-ccagatgtccaccttgaagc-3?) generating a PCR product of 797?bp
2480968:Twenty-five (17% of specimens) of the LKB1 mutations were detected in NSCLCs collected from patients in the United States, whereas only nine mutations (5% of specimens) were detected in the Korean cohort ( P =0.001) ( Table 1 )
2480968:No differences in survival were observed in patients who harboured both LKB1 and KRAS mutations compared with those with KRAS or LKB1 alone but the total number of patients with both mutations who had stages I or II NSCLC was small ( n =9; data not shown)
2480968:The mutations detected with SURVEOR-WAVE were confirmed by conventional DNA sequencing and they corresponded to previous reports ( Sanchez-Cespedes et al , 2002 ; Carretero et al , 2004 )
2480968:Frozen tumour tissues were collected from 809 out of 2442 patients who underwent curative resection for NSCLC from November 1995 to February 2007 at Samsung Medical Center
2480968:PCR products of LKB1 mutant cell lines were mixed 1?:?1 with the products from wild-type cell lines (H441) to generate heteroduplexes as LKB1 mutant cell lines were previously reported to be homozygous for the inactivation of the gene
2480968:Specimens that showed an altered pattern on the SURVEYOR tracings were purified using QIAquick kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and sequenced bi-directionally by molecular biology core facility of Dana�Farber Cancer Institute
2480968:The outcome of stages I and II NSCLC patients treated with surgery alone did not significantly differ based on LKB1 mutation status
2480968:Samples were excluded if ? -actin was not full length
2480968:The US cohort included specimens that have previously undergone analyses and the results have been published for EGFR, KRAS , and BRAF mutations ( Bhattacharjee et al , 2001 ; Naoki et al , 2002 ; Hayes et al , 2006 )
2480968:Previous reports have suggested the LKB1 mutation rate to be as high as 30% in NSCLC tumours and cell lines derived from patients of Caucasian origin ( Carretero et al , 2004 ; Matsumoto et al , 2007 ) and to be infrequent in NSCLC patients of Asian origin (3%) ( Onozato et al , 2007 )
2480968:As LKB1 mutant and wild-type cell lines expressed comparable amounts of LKB1 mRNA with RT�PCR, we studied the cDNA for mutations using the SURVEYOR-WAVE method
2480968:Previous reports have suggested that in NSCLC cell lines, LKB1 mutations often occur concurrently with KRAS or BRAF mutations ( Sanchez-Cespedes et al , 2002 ; Carretero et al , 2004 )
2480968:Mutant sequences for AD367 and AD368 are displayed from sequences using the forward primer while mutation of the AD362 is showed with reverse primer
2480968:Missense mutations in codons 176 and 194 have been previously characterised in PJS ( Launonen, 2005 )
2480968:The current study was designed to analyse the incidence of LKB1 mutations in NSCLC
2480968:Seventy tumours (23% in the whole tumour set, 9% in Caucasian, 34% in Asian specimens) had EGFR kinase domain mutations with only one of them occurring concurrently with an LKB1 mutation ( P =0.002)
2480968:A recent report of using a mouse model for lkb1 inactivation in NSCLC has provided insights into the role of the gene in this cancer
2480968:LKB1 wild-type cDNA (H441) was added to PCR products 1?:?1, denatured by heating and slowly renaturated to generate heteroduplexes since A549, H1395, and H23 have previously reported to be homozygous for the LKB1 mutations
2480968:SURVEYOR-WAVE mutation analyses of NSCLC tumours ( C )
2480968:Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the LKB1 mutational frequency in different histologies and ethnic backgrounds, and assess their correlation to smoking history, gender, stage, survival, and other oncogenic mutations in NSCLC
2480968:The WAVE HPLC provides a system to analyse DNA fragments smaller than 900?bp and therefore we designed two overlapping amplicons covering exons 1�5 (797?bp) and 5�9 (702?bp) to amplify the whole coding region of LKB1 mRNA
2480968:We detected an association of LKB1 mutations with a smoking history ( P =0.007) and only two mutations were detected in tumours from 72 NSCLC patients who were either never or light (?10 pack years) former smokers ( Table 1 )
2480968:Patients with PJS have an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal, pancreatic, breast, gynecological, and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC)
2480968:We reconfirmed the mutations in 30 of these specimens using the SURVEYOR-based analysis (see section SURVEYOR digestion and HPLC analysis) and found 100% concordance between the two methods (data not shown)
2480968:This tumour was wild type for KRAS (data not shown)
2480968:Some mutational hotspots were discovered
2480968:H2126 cell line, which is known to have homozygous deletion of exons 4�6, expressed mRNA with substantially smaller size (?1000?bp) corresponding to deletion of 398?bp
2480968:In the present study ?2 out of 3 of LKB1 mutant tumours were KRAS wild type ( Table 3 )
2480968:Subsequently, SURVEYOR-positive specimens are fractionated in partially denaturing conditions and are Sanger-sequenced
2480968:KRAS mutations were detected in 49 (16% in the whole tumour set, 25% in Caucasian and 8% in Asian specimens) tumour specimens with 10 (20% of KRAS mutants) of these occurring concurrently with an LKB1 mutation ( P =0.042) ( Table 3 )
2480968:PCR amplification was done using JumpStart Taq (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) under the manufacturer's guidelines
2480968:Briefly, frozen tissues were lightly stained with haematoxylin�eosin to improve visualisation, and necrotic tumour tissues and intervening normal tissues were removed
2480968:Frozen samples of resected lung tumours were obtained within 30?min of resection and subdivided into 100?mg samples and snap frozen at ?80�C
2480968:None of these cell lines had EGFR mutations
2480968:Current screening techniques for LKB1 tumour suppressor mutations rely on conventional exonic sequencing of the DNA, which can identify single base pair changes and small deletions/insertions ( Ballhausen and Gunther, 2003 )
2480968:SURVEYOR-WAVE analysis of the amplicon covering exons 1�5 revealed novel peaks with the cDNA for A549, and NCI-H1395 cell lines compared with the wild type from NCI-H441 ( Figure 1B )
2480968:The majority of the specimens ( n =167) was collected at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea
2480968:They tended to occur more commonly in adenocarcinomas (13%) than in squamous cell carcinomas (5%) ( P =0.066)
2480968:The reduction in statistical significance is likely owing to the loss of power associated with the overall rarity of LKB1 mutations among never or light former smokers
2480968:Our study also demonstrated that the LKB1 mutation frequency was significantly higher in cancers derived from a US population compared with those found in Korean patients (17 vs 5%; P =0.001)
2480968:AD367 and AD368 tumours showed novel peaks in the ex1�5 amplicon corresponding to 475C>T, Q159X, and 142_143delA, FS, truncation mutations
2480968:Denaturing formaldehyde gel electrophoresis followed by northern blotting using a ? -actin probe assessed RNA integrity
2480968:Kaplan�Meyer survival curves of stage I and II NSCLC patients with LKB1 wildtype (red line, n =198) vs LKB1 mutant (blue line, n =23) tumours.
2480968:Phosphorylation of AMPK by LKB1 is needed for full activity of AMPK and suppression of mTOR activity under low energy conditions ( Shaw et al , 2004 )
2480968:Six micrometres of frozen sections of embedded samples stained with haematoxylin and eosin were used to confirm the postoperative pathological diagnosis and to estimate the cellular composition of adjacent samples
2480968:Nevertheless, the higher rate of LKB1 mutation in adenocarcinomas compared with squamous cell carcinomas retains the same level of statistical significance (stratified P =0.064) after adjusting for fluctuation between ethnic groups
2480968:Time in minutes is shown on the X -axis, voltage in mV on the Y -axis ( B )
2480968:All patients provided written informed consent
2480968:All P -values were based on a two-sided hypothesis, with P <0.05 considered to be statistically significant and 0.05< P <0.10 considered to be borderline significant
2480968:H3255, H3255GR, HCC2279, and PC-9 have been previously described ( Ono et al , 2004 ; Tracy et al , 2004 ; Engelman et al , 2006 )
2480968:All specimens underwent pathological review by two pathologists
2480968:Furthermore, EGFR mutations are often mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations in NSCLC ( Kosaka et al , 2004 ; Marchetti et al , 2005 )
2480968:These differences may relate to the biological role of LKB1 in lung cancer
2480968:The reason behind these observations is presently unknown but might reflect the differences in carcinogen exposure in the lungs compared with other tissues
2480968:LKB1 is a challenging gene to analyse at the genomic DNA level because of its high guanine�cytosine content
2480968:Future studies will help further clarify whether LKB1 mutations occur concurrently with other genomic alterations in NSCLC and the impact of this on patient outcome
2480968:For this reason, we examined our tumours for BRAF mutations, which are found in 1�2% of NSCLC ( Naoki et al , 2002 )
2480968:However, a recent report has suggested that R426W is in fact a rare polymorphism of the gene ( Onozato et al , 2007 )
2480968:Thus our studies may underestimate the true LKB1 mutation frequency in NSCLC
2480968:We also found four F354L alterations (data not shown) but we did not consider these as missense mutations as this alteration has previously been reported to be a rare polymorphism of the gene ( Launonen et al , 2000 )
2480968:If a specimen showed an altered pattern on the SURVEYOR tracing but had a wild-type sequence by direct DNA sequencing, it underwent fractionation by WAVE HS HPLC in partially denaturing conditions
2480968:Additional studies are needed to clarify the prognostic impact of LKB1 mutations in humans with NSCLC
2480968:For LKB1 gene analysis, PCR primers were designed to amplify the cDNA in two amplicons
2480968:A part of the specimens ( n =103) was previously characterised for KRAS, BRAF, EGFR mutations using reverse transcritase (RT)�PCR and direct sequencing of the PCR products ( Naoki et al , 2002 ; Hayes et al , 2006 )
2480968:Somatic mutations of LKB1 tumour suppressor gene have been detected in human cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
2480968:Ma1, and Ma70 are NSCLC cell lines harbouring EGFR mutations that were established at the Kinki University, Osaka, Japan
2480968:Finally, 167 frozen tissues with acceptable quality of RNA (RNA Integrity Number (RIN) value over 7.0) were used for the current studies
2480968:For these analyses we combined both never smokers and light (?10 pack years) smokers as the frequency of mutations in other oncogenes such as EGFR is similar in these two patient groups ( Pham et al , 2006 )
2480968:LKB1 mutations associated with smoking history ( P =0.007) and KRAS mutations ( P =0.042) were almost mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations ( P =0.002)
2480968:The NSCLC cell lines A549, NCI-H1395, NCI-H1650, NCI-H1666, NCI-H1781, NCI-1975, NCI-H23, NCI-H2126, NCI-H441, NCI-H820, HCC2935, HCC4006, and HCC827 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA)
2480968:Tissue samples were homogenised in Trizol (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and RNA was extracted and purified by using the RNeasy column purification kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA)
2480968:Similarly, a recent study of 100 Japanese NSCLCs found that only 3% contained an LKB1 mutation ( Onozato et al , 2007 )
2480968:In addition, as many of the LKB1 mutations are small deletions ( Table 2 ) or involve deletions of entire exons, these would be missed using exon-specific genome sequencing methods
2480968:Conventional sequencing has also been used to detect mutations of LKB1 at mRNA level and some mutations missed by sequencing at the DNA level have been discovered by mRNA-based approaches ( Abed et al , 2001 )
2480968:The addition of multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), which enables detection of exonic and whole gene deletions, with exonic sequencing has increased the mutation detection rates to 80% in patients with PJS phenotype ( Volikos et al , 2006 )
2480968:PAJ, MM, and BEJ are part of a pending patent application on EGFR mutations
2480968:To adjust for any difference between ethnic groups, the association between LKB1 mutation rate and each characteristic was also evaluated as stratified contingency tables
2480968:Our method, however, does have limitations as it would miss deletions at the site of PCR primers, whole gene deletions, or deletions within the promoter region all of which have been infrequently detected in PJS ( Volikos et al , 2006 )
2480968:NSCLC tumours ( n =310) were collected from surgical resections from patients with stages I�IV NSCLC when sufficient material for RNA extraction was available
2480968:Fisher's exact test was used to assess the association of LKB1 mutation status with other clinical, pathological, and genetic characteristics
2480968:Reverse transcriptase�PCR amplification of the whole coding region of the LKB1 mRNA showed that cell lines with nonsense (A549, NCI-H23) mutations or 1?bp deletion (H1395) expressed mRNA with comparable size to the wild-type H441 cell line (1460?bp)
2480968:In addition, some of the BRAF mutant NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H1395, G469A; NCI-H1666, G466V) also contain a concurrent LKB1 mutation ( Sanchez-Cespedes et al , 2002 ; Bamford et al , 2004 ; Carretero et al , 2004 )
2480968:One possibility is that such tumours contain a concurrent mutation in another oncogene that activates the same signalling pathway as KRAS
2480968:Selected frozen tumour tissues were used for the microdissection
2480968:Our study employed a mutation scanning technology to screen for LKB1 mutations at the cDNA level ( Janne et al , 2006 )
2480968:RNA was extracted from tumours and cell lines using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), purified with Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and was used for cDNA synthesis using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)
2480968:Taken together our findings suggest that unlike KRAS , mutations in EGFR and LKB1 are mutually exclusive in NSCLC
2480968:Our study provides clinical and molecular characteristics of NSCLC, which harbour LKB1 mutations
2480968:Mice with concurrent KRAS mutations and LKB1 inactivation have more aggressive tumours and a shorter survival than those with only KRAS mutant cancers ( Ji et al , 2007 )
2480968:The tumours from Caucasian patients ( n =143) were collected at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA between 1991 and 1997 and have been previously published for patient characteristics and histology, and for expression profile-based clustering of the tumours ( Bhattacharjee et al , 2001 ; Hayes et al , 2006 )
2480968:Running temperatures for specific amplicons were calculated by the Navigator Software (Transgenomics, Omaha, NE, USA)
2480968:In support of this hypothesis, we find that LKB1 mutations are significantly ( P =0.007) more common in smokers than in never or light (?10 pack years) cigarette smokers ( Table 1 )
2480968:About one-half of the deletions and insertions were small, covering <15?bp ( n =14, 56%), whereas larger deletions ( n =11, 44%) covering hundreds of base pairs were detected in the remaining specimens
2480968:Consistent with prior studies we found a significant association with concurrent KRAS mutations, which are common in smokers ( Ahrendt et al , 2001 ), in one out of three of NSCLC with LKB1 mutations ( Table 3 )
2480968:SURVEYOR digestion and HPLC analysis were carried out as described previously ( Janne et al , 2006 )
2480968:However, mutant forms of LKB1 mRNAs can have a shortened half-life because of nonsense-mediated decay, which can potentially interfere with mutation detection ( Abed et al , 2001 )
2480968:One or two pieces from the periphery of the tumour masses � avoiding necrotic regions � were immediately frozen at �80�C until retrieved
